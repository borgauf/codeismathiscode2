** Why /The Little Schemer/?

/[[https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262560993/the-little-schemer/][The Little Schemer]]/ (TLS), written by computer science professors
Daniel P. Friedman and Matthias Felleisen, was a revolutionary book
when it came out in its first edition in 1987 as /The Little Lisper/
based on the programming language [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)][Lisp]]. Subsequent editions switched
to Lisp's younger sister language Scheme. The book was so unique
because it followed a "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method][Socratic]]" dialog style of question-and-answer
in left and right columns throughout the book, something never tried
before in math or computer science. Below is from the very first page
of the first chapter entitled /1. Toys/![fn:1]

This chatty conversation style is teasing out the requisite
/formalism/ [fn:2] where you the reader will hopefully experience a
growing mental picture of the important theory and language syntax as
the conversation continues and the pages turn. We are in effect
/backing into/ Scheme programming and its underlying philosophy---and,
indeed, underlying is quite a bit of important computer science.[fn:3]

Some things, however, are directly stated. Before the first chapter
/1. Toys/, even before the title page, there are listed (jokingly
named?) /The Ten Commandments/, followed by /The Five Rules/. Again,
this is a nod to the mathematical formalism of an /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_system][axiomatic
system]]/. Now, what do we mean by an axiomatic system and why are they
important? Before we go any further, we should have a good
understanding of what it meant by an axiomatic system. Why? Because
the world of computer science is based on axiomatic systems, as is
most of scientific inquiry and process.

** Axiomatic mathematics

Starting typically with algebra, math teachers begin asking students
to "show their work" when solving homework problems. Teachers want to
see all the /steps/ the student took to arrive at the final
answer. Why? Because by listing every step in solving a problem we
demonstrate our clear understanding of the whole process. And if we
didn't get the right answer, we can better find where we took a wrong
turn. Showing all steps is about moving towards a solution in a
verifiable way and leaving behind intuition, conditioned instincts,
hunches, and guesswork. Let's take "show your steps" further with
these foundational **rules** or **[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom][axioms]]**[fn:4] of algebra. Some of
these may be familiar, others not, and some will seem---odd---as in,
Why do we need to worry about that?

**Properties of Arithmetic**

For any numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$:

- **Axiom 1**: /Commutative properties---addition, multiplication/ \\
  $a + b = b + a\;; \quad ab = ba$
- **Axiom 2**: /Associative properties---addition, multiplication/ \\
  $(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)\;; \quad (ab)c = a(bc)$
- **Axiom 3**: /Distributive property/ \\
  $a(b + c) = ab + ac$
- **Axiom 4**: /Existence of identity elements/ \\
  There exist two distinct numbers, $0$ and $1$, such that for every
  $a$ we have $a + 0 = a$ and $1 \cdot a = a$
- **Axiom 5**: /Existence of negatives/ \\  
  For every number $a$ there is a number $b$ such that $a + b = 0$
- **Axiom 6**: /Existence of reciprocals/ \\  
  For every number $a \ne 0$ there is a number $b$ such that $ab = 1$,
  e.g., $b = \frac{1}{a}$

**Properties of Equality**

For any numbers $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$:

- /Reflexive property/ \\
  $a = a$ ...any number is equal to itself.
- /Transitive property/ \\
  If $a = b$ and $b = c$, then $a = c$ ...this property often takes the
  form of the substitution property, which says that if $b = c$, you can
  substitute $c$ for $b$. 
- /Symmetric property/ \\
  If $a = b$, then $b = a$
- /Addition property/ \\
  If $a = b$, then $a + c = b + c$ ...also, if $a = b$ and
  $c = d$, then $a + c = b + d$

- /Multiplication property/ \\
  If $a = b$, then $ac = bc$ ...also, if $a = b$ and $c = d$, then $ac = bd$
- /Division property/ \\
  If $a = b$, then $\frac{a}{c} = \frac{b}{c}$ provided $c \ne 0$
- /Square root property/ \\
  If $a^2 = b$, then $a = \pm\sqrt{b}$
- /Zero product property/ \\

Now let's look at an algebra problem and solve it step-by-step

⌜\\
𝖟𝕭: Solve $5x - 12 = 3(x + 2)$ for $x$: 
\begin{align*}
5x - 12 &= 3(x + 2) \quad \quad &&\text{Given} \\
5x - 12 &= 3x +6 \quad \quad &&\text{Distributive Law} \\
5x &= 3x + 18 \quad \quad &&\text{Addition property of equality} \\
2x &= 18 \quad \quad &&\text{Subtraction property of equality} \\
x &= 9 \quad \quad &&\text{Division property of equality} \\
\end{align*}
⌟ \\

All right, we've shown our work, step-by-step, but we also explained,
/justified/ each **rewrite** of each step with one of the rules above
--- /Distributive Law, Addition property of equality/, etc.[fn:5] Now,
it's highly doubtful any middle or high school algebra teacher asked
you to go into such depth. But as we mentioned above, in these axioms
are contained the complete basic rules of doing algebra. Really? Yes.

Granted, this may seem strange. As alluded to above, when you were
taught Algebra you did not learn in any such formal, systematic
way. Instead, you watched and imitated what the teacher was doing, you
looked for clues in the examples, and, basically, /internalized/ the
methods without questioning any further. In a sense, you were
/conditioned/ to do algebra, almost like a circus animal is taught to
perform tricks.[fn:6] This is how the vast majority of primary and
secondary education mathematics is taught, i.e., students are given
next to none of the underlying, theoretical math. There is hardly any
**[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formalism_(philosophy_of_mathematics)][mathematical formalism]]** employed. Rather, you were told over and
over, "When you see this, do this." The goal was not to understand
math at any fundamental or philosophical level, rather, to "solve
problems."  But this approach has an expiration date in your STEM
career.

**Axiomatic mathematics** is the mature, real-world approach to
mathematics where the parts are built through logical **deduction**,
truths established by basing every assertion on an underlying set of
ground-level rules or axioms. With an axiomatic system we start with a
collection of "givens," i.e., rules, laws, statements to be taken as
the most basic facts, then employ **[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning][deductive reasoning]]** to /prove/
further statements, known as **[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem][theorems]]**, which, taken together,
become the body of that particular branch of math. The goal changes
from "get problems solved" to attaining a higher level of
understanding, one where we will eventually be able to create new
mathematics. Again, whether or not you see axiomatic systems directly
discussed---as in higher math and computer science---real-world STEM
relies on this formalistic approach even when it's not obvious. Below
we will explore some examples of how math is really built from
theorems derived deductively based on axioms. And hopefully you will
begin to see the importance and necessity of axiomatic mathematics.

Here's Kenneth Rosen from his /[[https://www.mheducation.com/highered/product/Discrete-Mathematics-and-Its-Applications-Rosen.html][Discrete Mathematics and Its
Applications]]/ a widely-used college textbook in computer science
departments[fn:7]

#+begin_quote
To understand mathematics, we must understand what makes up a correct
mathematical argument, that is, a **[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_proof][proof]]**. Once we **prove** a
mathematical statement is true, we call it a **theorem**. A collection
of theorems on a topic organize [into] what we know about this topic.
#+end_quote

Let's take a quick /math holiday/[fn:8] to give an example of why proof is
so important to real-world math and computers.

⇲ @@html:<font color = "#0d3db3">@@ The **Collatz conjecture** is one
of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. Also known as the
$3n + 1$ problem, it is celebrated for its deceptive simplicity: a child
can understand the rules, yet the world’s greatest mathematicians have
failed to prove it for nearly a century.

Starting with any positive integer $n$, follow these two steps
repeatedly:

- If n is even: Divide it by 2 (\(n/2\)).
- If n is odd: Multiply it by 3 and add 1 (\(3n+1\)).


Example: Starting with n = 7

1. $7$ is odd: \((3\times 7)+1=22\)
2. $22$ is even: \(22/2=11\)
3. $11$ is odd: \((3\times 11)+1=34\)
4. $34$ is even: \(34/2=17\)
5. $17$ is odd: \((3\times 17)+1=52\)
6. $52$ is even: \(52/2=26\)
7. $26$ is even: \(26/2=13\)
8. $13$ is odd: \((3\times 13)+1=40\)
9. $40$ is even: \(40/2=20\)
10. $20$ is even: \(20/2=10\)
11. $10$ is even: \(10/2=5\)
12. $5$ is odd: \((3\times 5)+1=16\)
13. $16$ is even: \(16/2=8\)
14. $8$ is even: \(8/2=4\)
15. $4$ is even: \(4/2=2\)
16. $2$ is even: \(2/2=1\) (Target reached)

So running the computational procedure to get to the "trivial loop,"
i.e., we get to $1$ but then strictly following the recipe, we
multiply by $3$ and add $1$ getting $4$, which is even, then divide by
$2$ and we're back at $1$. If our software is not told to break the
loop, it will go on indefinitely, no?  @@html:</font>@@


Again, the everyday math we use is actually based on axiom-derived
theorems, even if so far they have only been presented as a big,
amorphous tool bag for solving problems.[fn:9] The axiom-to-theorems
approach is diametrically opposed to typical K-12 "muscle-memory" math
where the mantra is "Do enough problems and you'll catch on."

Tom Apostol in his /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_(Apostol_books)][Calculus...]]/[fn:10] textbook starts out with just
this sort of foundation-laying formalism when he says

⇲@@html:<font color = "#0d3db3">@@ Along with the set $\mathbb{R}$ of
real numbers we assume the existence of two operations called
**addition** and **multiplication**, such that for every pair of real
numbers $x$ and $y$ we can form the **sum** of $x$ and $y$, which is
another real number denoted by $x + y$, and the **product** of $x$ and
$y$, denoted by $xy$ or by $x \cdot y$, which is also another real
number. It is assumed that the sum $x + y$ and the product $xy$ are
uniquely determined by $x$ and $y$. In other words, given $x$ and $y$,
there is exactly one real number $x + y$ and exactly one real number
$xy$. We attach no special meanings to the symbols $+$ and $\cdot$ other
than those contained in the axioms.  @@html:</font>@@

...then he gives the /Properties of Arithmetic/ you see above, which
he calls **field axioms**. But doesn't this whole business seem
tedious, over-the-top? Can't we just /do/ adding and subtracting and
not get so lost in the weeds? But then Apostol boldly states,

#+begin_quote
All the workings of elementary algebra can be **deduced** from these
six axioms.
#+end_quote

We said this before, and yes, we'll see how below. But again, why all
this formalistic stuff? One way to answer this is to think about
computers and how math is done on them. Computers run **[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm][algorithms]]**
expressed in computer code written in computer programming
languages. We'll explore algorithms as we go, but suffice it to say,
when a computer "figures stuff out" it is using carefully constructed,
mathematically-based algorithms. Here's what [[https://gemini.google.com/app][Google Gemini AI]] said

#+begin_quote
The algorithmic way of thinking is a problem-solving approach focused
on breaking down complex challenges into a sequence of clear, logical,
and finite steps, much like a recipe or computer program, allowing for
systematic solutions that are precise, repeatable, and automatable for
both humans and machines, moving from general tasks like tying shoes
to complex scientific computations by defining rules and procedures
for achieving desired outcomes.
#+end_quote

Gemini goes on to list four steps of algorithmic thinking

- /Decomposition/: Breaking a big problem into smaller, manageable parts.
- /Pattern Recognition/: Identifying similarities or trends in the data or problem.
- /Abstraction/: Focusing on essential details while ignoring irrelevant ones.
- /Algorithm Design/: Creating step-by-step instructions to solve the problem. 

Now, here is the million-dollar question: Can we turn the
/Properties/, the field axioms, or Apostol's theory-heavy explanation
of sum and product above into lines of computer code, into algorithms
that do our algebra for us? It would be like using recipes from a
cookbook, no?  /Hold that thought/, because it is central to
everything we're doing here. /The connection between axiomatic math
and the algorithm-based computer world is vast and, dare we say,
downright magical./ Simply put, it comes down to the question, Can we
/operationalize/ something so the computer can be used.

Math did not have this level of rigorous formalism until the
late-1800s when the math world began asking itself, Can we really take
for granted the operations we do in arithmetic? The answer was they
came to was no. And so was birthed mathematics based on setting up
axioms then creating and proving a body of theorems. And throughout
modern STEM we see this model of establishing basic, given postulates,
facts, axioms, then using them to build theorems, the body of working
parts.

In the algebra example above, we also utilized /Properties of
Equality/, some of which for Apostol are technically theorems and as
such, must first be proven. His first **Theorem 1.1**, the
/Cancellation law for addition/, states

⇲@@html:<font color = "#0d3db3">@@ If $a + b = a + c$, then $b = c$. In
particular, this shows that the number $0$ of Axiom 4 is unique.
@@html:</font>@@

Then comes Apostol's proof:

⇲@@html:<font color = "#0d3db3">@@ Let us assume $a + b = a + c$ is
true. By Axiom 5 (see /Existence of negatives/ above), there is a
number such that $y + a = 0$. Since sums are uniquely determined, we
have $y + (a + b) = y + (a + c)$. Using the associative law, we obtain
$(y + a) + b = (y + a) + c$ or $0 + b = 0 + c$. But by Axiom 4 (see
/Existence of identity elements/ above) we have $0 + b = b$ and $0 + c
= c$, so that $b = c\:$. Notice that this theorem shows that there is
only one number having the property of $0$ in Axiom 4. In fact, if $0$
and $0^\prime$ both have this property, then $0 + 0^\prime = 0$ and $0 + 0 =
0$. Hence $0 + 0^\prime = 0 + 0$ and, by the cancellation law, $0 = 0^\prime$.

Got that? Yes, we're deep in the weeds, eyes glazed over, but it's for
a good cause. The whole intuitive idea of "whatever you do to one
side, you have to do the same to the other side" or "balancing the
equation" has just been formally explained and proved. But it's hard
to grasp the full meaning just yet. Let's look at this issue from
another angle by asking an AI (in this case [[https://grok.com/][Grok]]) to explain balancing
an equation in an axiomatic way. Some of this repeats the above
discussion; other things will be different, i.e., a new perspective, a
deeper dive. Peruse the following sections and their

  property or predicate involving \(x\), then \(P(a)\) holds if and
  only if \(P(b)\) holds. This is key: It allows us to replace equals
  with equals in expressions.

In higher math the concept of equality, of /sameness/ goes much deeper
and is more precise and nuanced than our everyday intuitive
understanding. Formally, equality is an /equivalence relation/ on
numbers. We'll look into exactly what a relation is in the higher math
sense soon. Grok's answer is compelling us to tackle some higher math,
which is based on **[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory][set theory]]** and **[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic][mathematical logic]]** developed
in the latter half of the nineteenth century on into the twentieth to
be an exhaustively thorough and foundational basis for math, upon
which all math could be axiomatically built. We will weave both sets
and logic into our presentations as we go. One part of math logic is
**[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic][first-order logic]]** or FOL. Again, nothing in depth now, but we'll
need an intro to FOL to understand what's being said in the
/Substitution Principle/ above.

In this first section of Grok's answer we see rules of equality
similar to the previous discussion, but this go-round we'll look
deeper under the hood. First is **reflexivity**, which might seem
/vacuous/[fn:12] and unnecessary to the layperson. Of course any given
thing is the same, /equal/ to itself. But consider this wording of
equality, i.e., /a relation each thing bears to itself and nothing
else/. But we have to state this explicitly to be thorough. Next,
**symmetry** is allowing expressions to swap sides of an equation,
i.e., what's on the left can go to the right and vice-versa, and
they're equality is not changed. Again, you were just conditioned to
accept this, but here it is formally stated.

Let's take a math holiday to look into FOL so we can
understand why, e.g., $\forall x \, (x = x)$ is the same as $a = b$.

But then comes the **Substitution Principle** where we're introduced
to the notion of a **predicate** $P(x)$ extends to functions and
operations: If \(a = b\), then for any function \(f\), \(f(a) =
f(b)\). "Doing the same thing" to both sides means applying the same
function or operation to both.

@@html:<font color = "#0d3db3">@@
⇲ **Algebraic structure: field axioms (redux)**

We work in a /field/ (like the real numbers \(\mathbb{R}\)), which has
two operations: addition (+) and multiplication (·), satisfying axioms
such as:
- **Commutativity**: \(a + b = b + a\), \(a \cdot b = b \cdot a\).
- **Associativity**: \((a + b) + c = a + (b + c)\), similarly for multiplication.
- **Distributivity**: \(a \cdot (b + c) = a \cdot b + a \cdot c\).
- **Identity Elements**: There exists 0 such that \(a + 0 = a\), and 1 such that \(a \cdot 1 = a\).
- **Inverses**: For every \(a\), there exists \(-a\) such that \(a + (-a) = 0\); for every \(a \neq 0\), there exists \(a^{-1}\) such that \(a \cdot a^{-1} = 1\).
- **Closure**: The set is closed under + and ·.

@@html:</font>@@  

These axioms define how operations behave, but equality ties them to the "balancing" rule.

*** Preserving equality through operations

Starting from an equation \(a = b\), applying the same operation to both sides preserves equality due to substitution and the field axioms. Here's how common operations are justified:

- **Adding the same value \(c\) to both sides**:  
  Consider the function \(f(x) = x + c\). By substitution, if \(a = b\), then \(f(a) = f(b)\), so \(a + c = b + c\).  
  (This uses the definition of addition as a binary operation.)

- **Subtracting the same value \(c\) from both sides**:  
  This is equivalent to adding \(-c\): \(a + (-c) = b + (-c)\), or \(a - c = b - c\).  
  Justified by the additive inverse axiom.

- **Multiplying both sides by the same value \(c\)**:  
  Function \(f(x) = x \cdot c\), so \(a \cdot c = b \cdot c\).  
  (If \(c = 0\), this preserves equality but may lose information, as both sides become 0.)

- **Dividing both sides by the same non-zero value \(c\)**:  
  Multiply by the multiplicative inverse \(c^{-1}\): \(a \cdot c^{-1} = b \cdot c^{-1}\), or \(a / c = b / c\).  
  The axiom requires \(c \neq 0\) to ensure \(c^{-1}\) exists.

More complex operations (e.g., squaring both sides) follow similarly: Define \(f(x) = x^2\) (which is \(x \cdot x\)), and apply substitution. However, note that some functions (like squaring) are not one-to-one, so they may introduce extraneous solutions, but equality is still preserved in the forward direction.

*** Why this maintains balance

The rule isn't arbitrary—it's a consequence of equality being an equivalence relation and operations being well-defined functions. If you only apply an operation to one side, you're no longer comparing equal expressions; you've changed one without the other, violating substitution. Axiomatically, this ensures that solving equations (e.g., isolating variables) is logically sound and leads to equivalent statements.

The multi-volume set [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#Axioms][Euclid's Elements]] (EE) from ca. 300 BC Greece is
generally accepted as being the first example of mathematics built on
*[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom][axioms]]* and built up through proven *[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem][theorems]]* based on those
axioms[fn:13] ... and EE has been, in one form or another, a part of
the Western world's math curricula ever since. It was once a staple of
high school math, /though often dreaded/, as it was the student's
first exposure to the strange idea of /proving/ math instead of just
doing math. Proving something in math requires a deep grasp of a
topic, which is completely different from the typical style of "when
you see this, do this" group behavior conditioning. Starting with
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#Axioms][Euclidean Geometry]], the student is asked to see a geometric
situation[fn:14] and understand why something about it is /necessarily/
(proven to be) true. The proof of, e.g., the /pons asinorum/ is a
step-by-step establishing of undeniable facts based on Euclid's
axioms, his /Postulates/ and /Notions/. Again, this was the beginning
of modern mathematics where a set of axioms could be called on to
build /theorems/, i.e., additional true things about the
situation. 

Axioms can go by many names, e.g., basic truths, givens, primitives. Here are
Euclid's *Five Postulates*


- P1 :: A straight line may be drawn between any two points.
- P2 :: Any terminated straight line may be extended indefinitely.
- P3 :: A circle may be drawn with any given point as center and any
  given radius.
- P4 :: All right angles are equal.
- P5 :: Through a given point $P$ not on a line $L$, there is one and
  only one line in the plane of $P$ and $L$ which does not meet $L$.

The last postulate is a more modern rewording of the original, meaning
/truly parallel lines may exist that never cross/. To these first
five, Euclid added another five basic truths, his *Common Notions*

- N1 :: Things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to
  each other.
- N2 :: If equals are added to equals, the wholes (results) are equal.
- N3 :: If equals are subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal.
- N4 :: Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another.
- N5 :: The whole is greater than a part of the whole.

With these ten axiomatic statements begins much geometry, logic,
number and set theory. That is to say, great amounts of /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_calculus#Inference_rules][implication]]/,
"if this then that" can be derived from these ten accepted
givens.[fn:15] For example, the last notion, N5, seems to say something
almost silly and trivial. But as [[http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/elements/bookI/cn.html][this treatment]] explains, N5 with its
odd wording starts whith the basic concept of one thing being /larger/
than another, i.e., $A>B$. Here's David E. Joyce's, professor of
mathematics at Clark University, explanation

#+begin_quote
To say one magnitude $B$ is a *part* of another $A$ could be taken as
saying that $A$ is the sum of $B$ and $C$ for some third magnitude
$C$, the remainder. Symbolically, $A > B$ means that there is some $C$
such that $A = B + C$.
#+end_quote

Again, to the novice this may look like nit-picking, but real math
comes from having these basic foundational givens---upon which new,
useful math is solidly, logically built. Higher math[fn:16] is the
realm of axiomatic math where proofs of /theorems/ are the
staple. Higher math is where the student becomes a real mathematician
who looks under the hood and learns what makes things really tick.

Let's consider a more serious-looking set of axioms, again, taken from
course material by Professor Joyce, then a proof of a theorem based,
i.e., relying on these axioms[fn:17]

1. Vector addition is /commutative/: $\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v}$.
2. Vector addition is /associative/: $(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) + \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} + (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w})$.
3. There is a vector, denoted $\mathbf{0}$ such that $\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{0} = \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0} + \mathbf{v}$.
4. For each $\mathbf{v}$, there is another vector $\mathbf{−v}$ such that $\mathbf{v} + (\mathbf{−v}) =
   0$.
5. Scalar multiplication /distributes/ over vector addition: $c(\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) =
   c\mathbf{v} + c\mathbf{w}$.
6. Scalar multiplication /distributes/ over real addition: $(c + d)\mathbf{v} = c\mathbf{v} + d\mathbf{v}$
7. Multiplication and scalar multiplication /associate/: $c(d\mathbf{v}) =
   (cd)\mathbf{v}$.
8. The number $1$ acts as /identity/ for scalar multiplication: $1\mathbf{v}
   = \mathbf{v}$.

And now we'll prove a very basic theorem relying on these axiom truths

⌜\\
@@html:<font color = "#650d1c">@@Proof: @@html:</font>@@ Since $0 + 0
= 0$, therefore we can say $(0 + 0)\mathbf{v} = 0\mathbf{v}$. By axiom *6*, that implies
$0\mathbf{v} + 0\mathbf{v} = 0\mathbf{v}$. If we could subtract $0\mathbf{v}$ from each side, we’d be
done, but subtraction isn’t yet defined. Still, we can add the
negation of $0v$ to each side which should accomplish about the same
thing. Thus,

\begin{align*}
(0\mathbf{v} + 0\mathbf{v}) + (−0\mathbf{v}) = 0\mathbf{v} + (−0\mathbf{v}).
\end{align*}

Next, we can associate the parentheses differently by axiom *2* to get

\begin{align*}
0\mathbf{v} + (0\mathbf{v} + (−0\mathbf{v})) = 0\mathbf{v} + (−0\mathbf{v}).
\end{align*}

That equation simplifies by axiom *4* to $0\mathbf{v} + 0 = 0$, and by
axiom *3*, that further simplifies to $0\mathbf{v} = 0$ which is what
was to be proved. *Q.E.D.*[fn:18] \\
⌟

Got it? No worries (yet) if you didn't. The point is to understand
that this so-call higher math thing wants to be built exclusively on
axioms. But yes, this is a strange world for the beginner so used to
the usual "get stuff calculated" math. For example, in beginner
algebra we never needed to /show/ with a proof that an entity times
zero is zero. So yes, here we have a thorough /proof/ of something
that we normally would have taken for granted. But again, this is the
world of higher math where math becomes more of a philosophy than just
a set of tools.[fn:19]

** Axiomatic Scheme

And now with no further ado we will list out TLS's version of
"axiomatic givens" starting with /The Ten Commandments/ below[fn:20]

- *First Commandment*: When recurring on a list of atoms, ~lat~, ask two
  questions about it ~(null? lat)~ and ~else~; when recurring on a
  number, ~n~, ask two questions about it: ~(zero? n)~ and ~else~;
  when recurring on a list of S-expressions, ~l~, ask three question
  about it: ~(null?  l)~, ~(atom? ( car l))~, and ~else~.
- *Second Commandment*: Use ~cons~ to build lists.
- *Third Commandment*: When building a list, describe the first typical
  element, and then ~cons~ it onto the natural recursion.
- *Fourth Commandment*: Always change at least one argument while
  recurring. When recurring on a list of atoms, ~lat~, use ~(cdr
  lat)~. When recurring on a number, ~n~, use ~(sub1 n)~. And when
  recurring on a list of S-expressions, ~l~, use ~(car l)~ and ~(cdr
  l)~ if neither ~(null? l)~ nor ~(atom? (car l))~ are true. [One
  argument] must be changed to be closer to termination. The changing
  argument must be tested in the termination condition: When using
  ~cdr~, test termination with ~null?~ and when using ~sub1~, test
  termination with ~zero?~.
- *Fifth Commandment*: When building a value with $+$, always use $0$
  for the value of the terminating line, for adding $0$ does not
  change the value of an addition.
- *Sixth Commandment*: Simplify only after the function is correct.
- *Seventh Commandment*: Recur on the /subparts/ that are of the same
  nature: on the sublists of a list; on the subexpressions of an
  arithmetic expression.
- *Eighth Commandment*: Use help functions to abstract from
  representations.
- *Ninth Commandment*: Abstract common patterns with a new function.
- *Tenth Commandment*: Build functions to collect more than one value at
  a time.

But wait there's more. Next are the /The Five Rules/

- *The Law of ~car~*: The primitive ~car~ is defined only for nonempty
  lists.
- *The Law of ~cdr~*: The primitive ~cdr~ is defined only for nonempty
  lists. The ~cdr~ of any nonempty list is always another list.
- *The Law of ~cons~*: The primitive ~cons~ takes two arguments. The
  second argument to ~cons~ must be a list. The result is a list.
- *The Law of ~null?~*: The primitive ~null?~ is defined only for lists.
- *The Law of ~eq?~*: The primitive ~eq?~ takes two arguments. Each must
  be a non-numeric atom.

Not many beginners can take these fifteen would-be axioms and know
exactly how to write a Scheme program.[fn:21] But then if you've read
and understood a textbook such as /[[https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~gill/BWLectSite/Resources/LDGbookCOV.pdf][Lists, Decisions and Graphs...]]/ by
Edward Bender and S. Gill Williamson, you might catch on that these
"fake" axioms are attempting is to establish some sort of
omnibus[fn:22] /list processing/ machinery. In fact Scheme's
predecessor, *Lisp*, is an acronym for "list processing," because this
is essentially what Lisp and Scheme do, i.e., they do computing tasks
with, on lists. Really?! So in Lisp and Scheme we have a complete
working programming language as just a bunch of lists stored in a
computer file that some sort of evaluator processes and gives results?
How does that work? Read on.

** List basics

At this point we take a theoretical look at what a list is, as the
humble list is the most basic data structure in programming. But then
we all know in the everyday sense what a list is, right? A grocery
list is a good example

- eggs
- milk
- flour
- potatoes
- butter

But we have a problem---at least with the math world. That's because
in higher math there are also **sets**. So what is the difference
between a list and a set? To the layman they might seem
interchangeable. /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory][Set theory]]/ is the fundamental starting point of
higher math, as well as CS's Discrete Math.[fn:23] And so many books
on set theory and discrete math start out with the deceptively simple
and informal statement

#+begin_quote
@@html:<font color = "#0d3db3"> <i>@@ A **set** is collections of
things ... objects ... stuff. @@html:</font> </i>@@
#+end_quote

...which is kind of what a list is too. But to CS and higher math they
are two different entities. What's the difference? First, our grocery
/list/ is not technically a list because, again, in the CS-higher math
world,@@html:<font color = "#0d3db3">@@ /the *elements* (members) of
a list have a specific order/ @@html:</font>@@. But then our grocery
list above could be in any order, doesn't really matter as long as you
come home with the those groceries...

Plainly put, lists are defined as a collection of things in a specific
order. Think of a /string/ of letters like you're reading right now. A
string of alphanumeric characters can be considered a list because
/the order of the individual alphanumeric characters (and spaces in
between) is everything/. We typically call strings of letters and
spaces /sentences/ ... where all the sentences in English are made up
of differing combinations of the twenty-six letters (times two if we
have both upper- and lower-case), as well as the ten numerals, all the
punctuation, and the space character. You can't be placing individual
characters in any order and still have sensible sentences. So is our
"grocery list" really a /set/ of groceries?

Actually no. We should not call a grocery list a /set of groceries/
either because even though order doesn't matter, sets allow
duplicates. They do. In set theory there is the idea of the
/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality][cardinality]]/ of a set, i.e., what is the count of the /unique/
elements of the set, /not/ counting duplicates.[fn:24]

⌜\\
𝖟𝕭: The set $A = \{1,1,1,2,2\}$ is /identical/ to set $B = \{1, 2\}$
because they have the same cardinality, or $|\,A\,| = |\,B\,| =
2$.[fn:25] \\
⌟\\

This can be explained in a few ways. The simplest is to say the
members, the elements of a set /belong/ to that set. So for example,
if I /belong/ to a club, it doesn't make sense to have me
/belong-belong/ or belong twice to the club.[fn:26] In the example
above, $1$ /belongs/ to $A$, so it doesn't need to belong again.

Splitting hairs? Yes, well, set theory is a very fundamental thing in
higher math, thus, very precisely defined based on axioms. For
example, set theory has the /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_extensionality][Axiom of Extensionality]]/ which states
@@html:<font color = "#0d3db3">@@ two sets are equal if they both have
the same members@@html:</font>@@. In our example $A$ and $B$ do indeed
have the same members, namely, $1$ and $2$ ---and it doesn't matter,
it doesn't count that $A$ repeats these members. Let's look at another
example

⌜\\
𝖟𝕭: Given the *set* $A = \{\text{good, so-so, bad}\}$ and a defined
(named) *list*

#+end_src
⌟\\

the set $A$ contains the three possible moods a person might be in;
while ~week3~ is the name we've told Scheme to call a list containing
our daily workweek moods.[fn:27] \\

The order of set $A$ doesn't matter (and we'd ignore, say, a second
$good$), but the order of the list defined as ~week3~ is important
because we don't want to mix up how we felt on which of the five work
days. Also, it makes perfect sense for a list to have "repeats" since
we're evaluating many days in succession, and each day can be one of
the three choices. But then notice one more thing about a set: When we
built the list ~week3~ we had to choose for each day ~good~ /or/ ~bad~
/or/ ~so-so~. Or did we? What would the list ~week3~ look like if we
could have more than just one mood during a day? How about

#+name: 5e0271e8-a0e4-430f-b594-f11e30c11403
#+begin_src scheme :eval never :exports code

#+end_src

Remember Venn diagrams? An /or/ situation can be shown with a **[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(set_theory)][union]]**
of circles.[fn:28] Let's make a formal definition of a union:[fn:29]

@@html:<font color = "#0d3db3">@@ The union of two sets $A$ and $B$
(denoted by $A \cup B$) is the set of elements which are in $A$, in $B$,

Now, for our set $A = \{\text{good, so-so, bad}\}$, if we are using
each element just once per the day slot of ~week3~ we could imagine
$A$ as made up of the individual /singleton/ sets, i.e., sets having
just one element

\begin{align*}
A_G &= \{\text{good}\} \\
A_{S} &= \{\text{so-so}\} \\
A_B &= \{\text{bad}\}
\end{align*}

and so a union $\{A_G \cup A_{S} \cup A_B \}$ will get us back to our original
$A = \{\text{good, so-so, bad}\}$. $A_G$, $A_{S}$, and $A_B$ are
**[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_sets][disjoint sets]]** since they have no elements in common when we
union-ize them. And so if we made a Venn diagram, there would be no
overlap between any of them. Why are we couching our daily mood
choices in the language of set theory? Because we will eventually move
on to another language, namely, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell][Haskell]], where a certain class of data
types emulate just this sort of **[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction][logical or]]**, i.e., the **sum
type**. While Scheme is usually not directly explained in terms of
higher math, the Haskell family of languages (Haskell, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ML][Standard ML]],
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCaml][OCaml]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_Sharp_(programming_language)][F#]]) are. Again, lots more about data representations of
disjoint sets, logical conjunction and disjunction when we look into
Haskell in the future.

𝖟𝕭: Consider three common alphabets as sets---the Greek, Latin, and
Cyrillic alphabets

Below we see a Venn diagram for $A$, i.e., circles in which the
/three/ sets of alphabetic characters are contained. We can see how
the intersecting circumference lines also show the what /any two/

Of course for visual purposes not /all/ the letters could be crowded
into the diagram above, but we can see how the Venn diagram with its
overlapping circles trick is beating duplicates. Visually we can see
this happening, but is there a formal explanation? Short answer: yes.

Now let's look at a formal definition of union in so-called
**set-builder notation**[fn:31]

\begin{align}
A \cup B = \{x : x \in A \lor x \in B  \}
\end{align}

This expression says the **union** of $A$ and $B$ equals the set of
elements denoted by $x$ such that an $x$ can be an element from[fn:32]
$A$ *or* an element from $B$.[fn:33] But wait, *or* doesn't quite
sound right in English if we mean to union-ize two or more things,
does it?  To bring two or more sets together as one---their unique and
shared element alike---don't we mean to say, e.g., @@html:<font color

And with one final piece of the puzzle we can put to rest this whole
duplicates within sets issue. Let's explore another logic concept that
we actually encounter every day. In the modern world we're constantly
turning things on and off, e.g., a light switch with its on-off
toggle. But occasionally we see /two/ buttons---/one/ for on, /one/
for off. In the image to the right we have /two/ buttons doing on and
off instead of one. In such a case pushing the green /on/ button just
one initial time turns the device on /and any additional pushing is
disregarded/. This is the same for the red /off/ button. Push once for
off---and any further pushes mean nothing. Basically, "I heard you the
first time, you don't have to repeat yourself." This phenomenon has an
official name: **[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence][idempotence]]**, and it crops up in many real-life
places. For our set theory discussion imagine making a Venn diagram of
the union of sets $S_1 = \{5\}$ and $S_2 = \{5\}$, i.e., two different
sets containing the same single element. Wouldn't this union be just
one single circle containing the element $5$? Indeed it would. And if
we added another set $S_3 = \{5\}$ to the union, we would still have

\begin{align*}
S_1 \cup S_2 \cup S_3 = \{5\}
\end{align*}

i.e., just one circle representing $5$. In fact, we could union
together an infinite amount of **singleton**[fn:34] sets of the form
$S_n = \{5\}$ and they would produce the singleton set $\{5\}$. Now
for a bit of abstraction. Consider a **[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_operation][binary operator]]**, i.e., any
math that takes two objects and does an operation on them to produce
something new. For example, addition is a binary operation, $1 + 1$ is
$2$, as is multiplication, $3 \cdot 5$ is $15$. Let's then use the
abstract symbol $\oplus$ to indicate any sort of binary operator. Now we
can establish a formal definition of idempotence \\

@@html:<font color = "#0d3db3">@@
- A **binary operation** $\oplus$ is said to be **idempotent** on a set $S$ if
  $x \oplus x = x \,\,\text{for all}\,\, x \in S$
- An element $x$ of a set $S$ is said to be **idempotent** under a
  binary operator $\oplus$ if $x \oplus x = x$
@@html:</font>@@

If multiplication is the binary operator on the set of all counting
numbers $\mathbb{N}$ then what numbers of $\mathbb{N}$[fn:35] can we
call idempotent according to the definition? Well, only $0$ and $1$
are idempotent:

\begin{align*}
0 \cdot 0 &= 0 \\
1 \cdot 1 &= 1
\end{align*}

All other numbers ($x \gt 1$) give increasingly larger squares of
themselves, hence, $0$ and $1$ are idempotent, but the binary
operation of multiplication is not.[fn:36]

Now, let's consider something that came up in a [[https://math.stackexchange.com/][StackExchange
Mathematics]] discussion [[https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/155475/1-1-1-origin-of-this-convention][here]], which is tackling our issue of duplicates
in a set by asking, why is $\{1,1\} = \{1\}$? Below we have a slight
re-wording of the preferred, green-checked answer:

@@html:<font color = "#0d3db3">@@
An unordered tuple $\{a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4\dots\}$ is defined as \\
\begin{align*}
\{x:x=a_1 \lor x=a_2 \lor x=a_3 \lor x=a_4 \lor\dots\}.
\end{align*}
By this convention,
\begin{align}
\{1,1\} = \{x:x=1 \lor x=1 \}
\end{align}
So by the /idempotency/ of $\lor$ we have (2) the same as $\{ x : x = 1
\}$, hence,
\begin{align*}
\{1,1\} = \{1\}
\end{align*}
@@html:</font>@@

Notice we are relying on the **logical-or** binary operator being
idempotent for all $x$ in the set. Generally, an **unordered n-tuple**
is a set of the form $\{a_1,a_2,\ldots, a_n\dots\}$, although a **tuple** is
usually meant to be **ordered**.[fn:37] Again, idempotency of two
identical sets is obvious when seen as Venn diagrams, but now we've
seen in exact language how they are idempotent.

By the way, **union** and **logical or** are complimentary ideas. Consider
this expression

\begin{align}
a \in X \cup Y \iff a \in X \lor a \in Y
\end{align}

What does that double-arrow in the middle mean? **if and only
if**. We'll go into $\iff$ in more exact detail later, but for now it
means @@html:<font color = "#0d3db3">@@the truth of one side of the
$\iff$ requires the other side to be true also.@@html:</font>@@ So if
$a$ is an element of the union of $X$ and $Y$ then $a$ must be an
element of $X$ /or/ it is an element of $Y$ /or/ it is an element of
/both/ $X$ and $Y$ ---and the other way around as well. Note: we avoid
writing $X \lor Y$ when considering just the sets without involving the
elements therein.

** Summing up; data and data structures

We didn't even get off the first page of TLS, but we have laid some of
the groundwork we'll need to proceed. And we can't emphasize this
enough: Computer science is a branch of applied mathematics, and we
need to get the math going alongside, parallel to the computer
stuff. So expect more new math. Yes, this sort of math takes
concentrated, deliberate thinking. We're becoming philosophers, i.e.,
we're going beyond "plug-and-chug" math.

Next, **lists**. While this lesson was an informal introduction to
lists, we'll learn more about how they are a very simple but important
data structure in computer **data management** ... but then we're
using the term data management differently then the greater lay world
does. So a quick word about the whole concept of **data** and **data structures** before we really dive in ahead. Today the term /data/ is
mainly understood to be gobs and gobs of stuff held in databases or
other storage schemes. That's not what we mean by data. For us /data/
can simply be a number returned from an algorithm. That is to say,
data is what the programming logic, the /code/ is taking in, working
on, then giving back to us. Yes, of course, this production of data
can pool and amass into great piles in vast electronic storage bins,
but, for instance, this is data

#+name: 6ce99fb1-93d3-4a72-9e01-5d9b96f3c682
#+begin_src scheme :eval never :exports code
'(bad bad so-so so-so good)
#+end_src

i.e., just a simple list surrounded in parentheses and prefaced at the
beginning by a quotation mark ("'") as is the custom in Scheme (and
Lisp). That quote at the opening parenthesis indicates this is not
code, rather, data. What we saw above

#+name: e4667fd4-1f04-4d95-ac36-ee0ee01b44ca
#+begin_src scheme :eval never :exports code
(define week3 '((bad bad so-so so-so good))
#+end_src

is therefore a mixture of both code and data---making it our first
Scheme program, even if it is just one line long! As we progress we'll
get into the weeds on just how this mixture of code and data can work
together.

formalism---although it's a bit formal...

[fn:3] Despite containing actual Scheme programs, i.e., real code, TLS
was written so that a layperson could follow along with no access to
nor knowledge of computers, e.g., even someone from the nineteenth
century such as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace][Ada Lovelace]]!

[fn:4] **axiom**: From the Greek /axíōma/ meaning /for that which
commends itself as evident/.

[fn:5] An entire field of higher math is devoted to just this sort of
reducing and substituting. What we see with our algebra problem can be
considered in a general sense as /directed replacement/ of terms, aka
**[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_rewriting_system][term rewriting]]**. And when something can't be /simplified/ any
further, it's considered in **[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_form_(abstract_rewriting)][normal form]]**. Where is formalized
rewriting important? For one with **[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra_system][computer algebra systems]]**, which
must know at an automated algorithmic level how to solve algebra
problems.

[fn:6] Mathematician Eugenia Cheng talks about Kindergartners learning
the "counting poem." Children are taught to count to ten on their
fingers, $1,2,3,\ldots$. Now, are they really learning anything of the
mathematical symbolism of numbers---or are they just imitating,
rote-learning a group activity?

[fn:7] More about proofs soon.

[fn:8] A /math holiday/ is a euphemism for taking a detour to delve
into some math topic necessary to advance the discussion.

[fn:9] ...although the so-called Common Core curriculum initiatives
was supposed to address this "mile wide but an inch deep" problem with
American public K-12 math curricula. Some of the early CC textbooks
attempted to integrate more of an axiomatic approach, especially
offering more emphasis on **[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics][discrete]]** mathematics, the math of
computers. /Lots/ more on discrete math as we go.

[fn:10] Apostol's /Calculus, Volume 1: One-variable calculus, with an

[fn:11] Content starting with a ⇲ symbol and in blue is what Grok
has told us (with some editing, addendum for clarity). Following in black
is more discussion, explanations.

[fn:12] In math and logic a **vacuous truth** is a statement that is
true, can't be refuted, but isn't really saying anything. For example,
the statement /All cell phones in the room are off/ would be vacuously
true if there were no cell phones in the room to begin with. In logic
vacuousness gets trickier. An example might be /When pigs fly, I'll
change my socks/. This contains a false premise, i.e., /when pigs fly/,
making the changing of socks impossible to ascertain.

[fn:13] A *[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjecture][conjecture]]* is a tentative *[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposition][proposition]]* that may evolve to
become a theorem if proven true. Conjectures are mathematical
statements unproven but useful for consideration. Propositions are
"objects of belief," e.g., if someone believes that the sky is blue,
the /object/ of their belief is the /proposition/ that the sky is
blue.

[fn:14] For example the (in)famous /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pons_asinorum][pons asinorum]]/ in /Euclid's
Elements/ \\
[[file:images/Byrne_pons_asinorum.jpg]] \\
where it is /proven/ that indeed the angles opposite the equal sides
of an isosceles triangle are themselves equal.

[fn:15] In mathematical logic the idea of /implication/ is very
fundamental. Something /implies/ something else; because $A$, that
means $B$ as well. Implication goes by many names: /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_conditional][material
conditional]]/, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_ponens][modus ponens]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_consequence][logical consequence]]. We first see
implication in programming with the basic /if-then-else/ conditional
starting with our third chapter.

[fn:16] /Higher math/ in the U.S. typically means those college math

degree, i.e., those courses /after/ Calculus, Differential Equations,

[fn:17] These axioms relate to Linear Algebra.

[fn:19] Go ahead and take a "math holiday" by touring [[http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/elements/bookI/cn.html][this page]] by
Professor Joyce. He is speaking from a quasi-[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory][set theory]] standpoint,
i.e., the basis of modern high math. But remember, Euclid was talking
strictly about geometric shapes. Set theory had not been invented
yet...

[fn:20] Do /not/ worry about what all this means. In time we will
explain all the Scheme programming syntax contained here. More
importantly, just realize how a programming language is actually based
on rules exactly like high math is built on axioms.

[fn:21] ...if we could, would each program we write technically be a
new *theorem*? More on that later. Specifically, we'll look into
Douglas Hofstadter's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MU_puzzle][MU puzzle]] from his ground-breaking book [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach][Gödel,
Escher, Bach]] (1979).

[fn:23] ...although it may be veiled or only partially explored.

[fn:24] We indicate the cardinality of a set $A$ by surrounding it
with vertical pipes: $|\,A\,|$ This is similar to the idea of a
number's /absolute value/ which uses the same vertical bar symbols.

[fn:25] 𝖟𝕭 is German for /zum Beispiel/ or /for example/.

[fn:26] ...paying double membership fees?

[fn:27]  Notice once again the nested parentheses. To be sure,
everything in Scheme is a list.

[fn:29] $\cup$ is the symbol for union.

[fn:30] Could we have said, ...in $A$ *and* in $B$ *and* in both $A$
and $B$? Better not. More on why later.

[fn:31] (1) can be expanded for the union of more sets than just
two, e.g., $A \cup B \cup C \cup \ldots$.

[fn:32] The symbol $\in$ means "in" or "member of."

[fn:33] $\lor$ is the symbol for **[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction][logical or]]**, aka **logical
disjunction**. Take a crack at the Wikipedia article.

[fn:34] As we saw above, a **singleton** (also known as a **unit set**
or **one-point set**) is a set with exactly one element.

[fn:35] $\mathbb{N}$ is the symbol for the /natural/ numbers, i.e., the
positive integers $1$, $2$, $3\ldots$ we use to count things.

[fn:36] In her 2023 layman's book /The Joy of Abstraction/
mathematician Eugenia Cheng notes how the operation of mixing paint
colors is basically idempotent. Why? If we add one paint to one other
paint we always get just one new paint color. That is, there is never
an additive or multiplicative increasing or intensifying, just a new
color. Now, how can we explain the green on-button above in terms of
set-theory idempotency?

[fn:37] ...such as, e.g., a pair of /Cartesian coordinates/ $(a,b)$
where $a$ is some real number on the /x-axis/ and $b$ is a real number
on the /y-axis/. Obviously, with a Cartesian coordinate system $(a,b)
\neq (b,a)$, since they'd be entirely different points on the plane. The
only exception would be if $a = b$.
