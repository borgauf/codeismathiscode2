As mentioned previously, <i>functional</i> programming, as opposed to
<i>procedural</i> or <i>imperative</i> programming, emphasizes <i>functions</i> as
the computational building blocks. Key is how functions in functional
programming languages behave as if they were true mathematical
functions. This is a great advantage&#x2014;for reasons we will explore in
detail as we progress.
</p>

<p>
Computer programming has advanced from the early days of literally
having to give <i>commands</i> imperatively, one after the other, to the
electronic organs of the CPU<label id='fnr.1' for='fnr-in.1.3344225' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.1.3344225' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup>
<b>CPU</b>: central processing unit, the calculation &ldquo;brains&rdquo; of a
computer.
</span> (and the memory attached to it) in
order to, e.g., perform simple addition or subtraction. For an
analogy, imagine having to tell your body exactly how to breathe. That
would be very restricting, taking up so much of your attention and
concentration. And so your brain simply handles breathing
semi-automatically at a lower, unconscious level. Similarly, in order
to be more productive, programming languages have striven over the
years to <i>abstract</i> the gnarly details of getting data and
calculations handled away from having to literally tell the CPU or the
&ldquo;bare metal&rdquo; each and every low-level step of a calculation.
</p>

<p>
For the time being, let&rsquo;s consider a quick, ad hoc definition of a
function and then later really take the idea of a function apart and
analyze it in a higher math way <br>
</p>

<p>
⇲<font color = "#0d3db3"> A <b>function</b> is a <i>relation</i> <label id='fnr.2' for='fnr-in.2.5913226' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.2.5913226' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup>
&#x2026;more about <i>relations</i> in a higher math way later.
</span>
between a <i>set</i> <label id='fnr.3' for='fnr-in.3.8263294' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.3.8263294' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup>
&#x2026; <i>set</i> as in set theory sets. Some very formal texts call a
set a <i>class</i>, by the way.
</span> whose elements are inputs (the <i>domain</i>) and a
set whose elements make up outputs (the range) with the key property
that <i>each input is related to exactly one output</i>.<label id='fnr.4' for='fnr-in.4.4017446' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>4</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.4.4017446' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>4</sup>
This important quality of a function was touched on in the
preface.
</span>
</font> <br>
<br>
Let&rsquo;s also look at a function in terms of <i>variables</i>. Recalling the
usual pre-algebra way of denoting a function, i.e., \(y = f(x)\), the
symbol \(x\) stands for input and is called an <b>independent variable</b>,
while the symbol that stands for output, \(y\), is called a <b>dependent
variable</b>. And so the dependent variable of the range <i>depends</i> on the
independent variable of the domain.<label id='fnr.5' for='fnr-in.5.4849930' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>5</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.5.4849930' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>5</sup>
In pre-algebra a function is typically graphed with the
horizontal axis representing the <i>independent variable</i> and the
vertical axis representing the <i>dependent variable</i>. <br>
<img src="images/Polynomialdeg2.png" alt="Polynomialdeg2.png"> <br>
In this idea of the function, y is the <i>dependent variable</i> and x is
the <i>independent variable</i>.
</span>
</p>

<p>
At this point in our journey we need to be clear about what is meant
in the math and CS literature by an <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(mathematics)">expression</a></b>&#x2014;a <i>mathematical</i>
expression, an <i>algebraic</i> expression, et cetera. Then we will launch
into the next topic in TLS, namely <b>s-expressions</b> or <i>symbolic</i>
expressions, which are the building blocks of Scheme programs. Here&rsquo;s
Wikipedia&rsquo;s first-paragraph definition of a mathematical expression <br>
<br>
⇲ <font color = "#0d3db3"> In mathematics, an <b>expression</b> is
a written arrangement of symbols following the context-dependent,
syntactic conventions of mathematical notation. Symbols can denote
numbers, variables, operations, and functions. Other symbols include
punctuation marks and brackets, used for grouping where there is not a
well-defined order of operations.  </font> <br>
<br>
&#x2026;which is admittedly a bit dense and too general. But then the
article gives the example \(7x - 5 = 2\) where the whole thing as one is
considered an <i>equation</i>, while the left- and right-hand sides by
themselves are called <i>expressions</i>. And then the example of the
inequality \(8x - 5 \ge 3\) is referred to as a <i>formula</i>, and again, the
\(8x - 5\) part and the \(3\) part are expressions. But can equations can
be expressions too? After all the basics of an expression, i.e., the
&ldquo;symbols&rdquo; and &ldquo;syntactic conventions,&rdquo; are maintained.
</p>

<p>
One important trait of expressions (which is very important in
functional programming) is that expressions may be evaluated or
simplified to find equivalent values. The expression \(8 \cdot 5 - 2\)
simplifies to \(16 - 5\) and then evaluates to \(11\). And sometimes a
mathematical expression comes from transcribing a statement, e.g.,
&ldquo;One number is six more than half of another number.&rdquo; So if we
represent the &ldquo;other number&rdquo; as \(a\) then a mathematical expression of
this statement could be
</p>

\begin{align*}
\frac{a}{2} + 6
\end{align*}

<p>
Let&rsquo;s give a simplified, more direct definition of an expression <br>
<br>
⇲<font color = "#0d3db3"> An <b>expression</b> is a mathematical
phrase that can contain ordinary numbers, variables such as \(x\) or \(y\)
and operators such as the symbols for add, subtract, multiply, divide,
and equals.  </font> <br>
<br>
And so an equation (built around an equals sign) can be an expression
after all.<label id='fnr.6' for='fnr-in.6.8791831' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>6</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.6.8791831' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>6</sup>
What follows was taken from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mathematics/comments/wseco9/is_function_an_expression/">this</a> reddit discussion.
</span> If an expression is, as restated from above,
<font color = "#0d3db3">any way of combining numbers and
symbols in a way that is syntactically correct</font>, then
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>\(1 + 2\)</li>
<li>\(3x - 5\)</li>
<li>y = x</li>
</ul>

<p>
are all expressions&#x2014;while \(5+ = 7\) means nothing because its syntax
is garbled. And so an equation is an expression that expresses
<i>equality</i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>But then is a function an expression?</i>
The <i>expression</i> \(y = f(x)\) tells us that for the function \(f\) we have
\(x\) as the independent variable and \(y\) then <i>depends</i> on which \(x\) is
being evaluated.
</p>

<p>
𝖟𝕭: \(y = e^x\) is an expression because, first and foremost, it is
syntactically valid; <i>and</i> it is an equation because of the equals
sign. But is it a function? Just in this form we haven&rsquo;t decided which
is the dependent or the independent value. We could plug in (a)
value(s) for \(y\) and get an \(x\) <i>or</i> plug in (a) value(s) for \(x\) and
get a \(y\) as it is now written. To be specific we could write it as
</p>

\begin{align*}
y = f(x) = e^x
\end{align*}

<p>
and now we have established which is independent (\(x\)) and which is
dependent (\(y\)).
</p>

<p>
𝖟𝕭: \(7a + 2b + 3c\) is clearly an <i>algebraic</i> expression but it does
not have to be a function, since the symbols \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) don&rsquo;t
necessarily have to be variable inputs, rather, constants previously
assigned numerical values. But if \(a\) is indeed a dependent variable
we would have the function
</p>

\begin{align}
f(a)=7a+2b+3c
\end{align}

<p>
⥤ Food for thought: \(a\) is a dependent variable in (1) and the symbols
\(b\) and \(c\) must then be constants. But could more than just \(a\) be a
variable? If so, how could we express this? How about as a function of
multiple variables?
</p>

\begin{align}
f(a,b,c)=7a+2b+3c
\end{align}

<p>
(2) tells us all three letter symbols stand for variables. Later when
we define what a Cartesian coordinate system really is, we&rsquo;ll also
touch on the world of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics">combinatorics</a></i>, or the science of counting or
sampling combinations of different sets, which is really what&rsquo;s going
on with this function-expression thingy.
</p>

<p>
Bottom line: We will indeed say <font color = "#0d3db3">all
functions are expressions.</font>

<div id="outline-container-org6ee8555" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org6ee8555">S-expressions TLS-style</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6ee8555">
<p>
Now we will discuss the idea of a <b>symbolic expression</b> or
<b>s-expression</b> as Lisp and Scheme mean it. On page 4 of TLS we&rsquo;re
suddenly confronted with, no explanation or warning, the term
<i>S-expression</i>
</p>

<p>
<span class="schemer">Βιγ Σξηεμερ:</span> Is it true
that this is a list? <br>
<code>(atom turkey) or</code> <br>
<span class="schemer">Λιττλε Σξηεμερ:</span> No,
because these are actually two <b>S-expressions</b><label id='fnr.7' for='fnr-in.7.7675764' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>7</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.7.7675764' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>7</sup>
We will use <b>sexp</b> the abbreviation for S-expression.
</span> not enclosed by
parentheses. The first one is a list containing two atoms, and the
second one is an atom.
</p>

<p>
Again, the discussion progresses by <i>backing into</i> constructing the
definition of sexp&rsquo;s by first giving key examples. This method is the
reverse of what higher math usually does. How? Because higher math
will typically state a rule, a proposition fundamental to the topic at
hand, and then proceed with discussion and examples of what the
fundamental law <i>implies</i>, i.e., what facts and uses unfold, are
necessitated by that law. For example, a higher math text might state
<br>
<br>
<font color = "#0d3db3"> The set of counting numbers, the
<i>natural</i> numbers, \(\mathbb{N}\), is <b>closed</b> under binary operators
addition and multiplication.  </font> <br>
<br>
Then a discussion would ensue as to why \(\mathbb{N}\) is not
closed<label id='fnr.8' for='fnr-in.8.8811130' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>8</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.8.8811130' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>8</sup>
A set of elements is <b>closed</b> under a binary operation if by
applying the operation to any two elements of the set the result is
also an element of the set. For example, \(2 + 2\) is \(4\), which is also
an element of the natural numbers \(\mathbb{N}\).
</span> under, say, subtraction and division by asking
if<font color = "#0d3db3"> the operation \(5 - 6\) result in an
element of \(\mathbb{N}\)?</font> No, because evaluating the
expression \(5 - 6\) results in \(-1\) and \(-1 \notin \mathbb{N}\), rather, \(-1
\in \mathbb{Z}\) which is the set of all <b>integers</b>, i.e., positive and
negative whole numbers along with \(0\).
</p>

<p>
Rather than copy the Big/Little Schemer chat verbatim, we&rsquo;ll just
compile the examples directly
</p>

<p>
𝖟𝕭: <code>((atom turkey) or)</code> is a list because the two sexp&rsquo;s are grouped
completely inside parentheses. <br>
𝖟𝕭: <code>xyz</code> is an sexp because all atoms are sexp&rsquo;s. <br>
𝖟𝕭: <code>(x y z)</code> is an sexp because it is a list. <br>
𝖟𝕭: <code>((x y) z)</code> is an sexp because all lists are sexp&rsquo;s. <br>
𝖟𝕭: <code>(how are you doing so far)</code> is an sexp because it is a collection
of sexp&rsquo;s enlosed by parentheses. <br>
𝖟𝕭: <code>(((how) are) ((you) (doing so)) far)</code> is a list because it
is a collection of sexp&rsquo;s enclosed by parentheses. <br>
𝖟𝕭: The list <code>(((how) are) ((you) (doing so)) far)</code> has <i>three</i> sexp&rsquo;s which
are <code>((how) are)</code>, <code>((you) (doing so))</code>, and <code>far</code>.<label id='fnr.9' for='fnr-in.9.3919073' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>9</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.9.3919073' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>9</sup>
At this point you might be getting lost in all the
parentheses. Don&rsquo;t worry, Emacs and other editors for Lisp and Scheme
have parentheses-matching highlighting so you always know which
enclosing set of parentheses you are in.
</span>
</p>

<p>
So it&rsquo;s obvious that Scheme is organized into sexp&rsquo;s. But why, how?

<div id="outline-container-org9c54a6f" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org9c54a6f">S-expression theory</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9c54a6f">
<p>
The first part of the term s-expression is <i>symbolic</i>, but what is
meant by symbolic? Obviously, symbolic is an adjective that means
whatever it is referring to has <i>symbol-like</i>
characteristics. Wikipedia starts its article on mathematical symbols
with this simple and probably too general definition <br>
<br>
<font color = "#0d3db3">A <b>mathematical symbol</b> is a figure
or a combination of figures that is used to represent a mathematical
object, an action on mathematical objects, a relation between
mathematical objects, or for structuring the other symbols that occur
in a formula. As formulas are entirely constituted with symbols of
various types, many symbols are needed for expressing all
mathematics.</font> <br>
<br>
Before we start going around in circles, what is meant by &ldquo;figures&rdquo; is,
e.g.,
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>decimal digits</b>, i.e., \(0\), \(2\), \(3\), &#x2026;</li>
<li><b>Latin</b>, <b>Greek</b>, <b>Hebrew</b> alphabet characters, i.e., \(a\), \(b\),
\(\mathbb{C}\), \(\beta\), \(\rho\), \(\Gamma\), \(\beth\), \(\aleph\), et cetera, which can have
different weights and typefaces for different uses.</li>
<li>Various operation and binder symbols, i.e., \(+\), \(-\), \(\sum\) for summation,
\(\int\) for integration, et cetera.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Without getting too philosophical, we may stop and marvel at how
humans have come to use and manipulate symbols, starting with the use
of language. With human language we use <b>words</b> which <i>symbolize</i> real
things or concepts. A word can be considered a <i>placeholder</i> for an
object or idea. Some experts say humanity has only possessed real
words-as-placeholder-symbols for forty thousand years. Others say
sixty to one-hundred thousand years. And yet we surely have been
anatomically <i>Homo sapiens</i> longer than we&rsquo;ve had language. What did
we, with our big brains, do before we had language? Obviously, we had
only intuitions, i.e., we would see two piles of nuts and only have
vague intuitive notions that there were two piles and they might
differ in size&#x2026; But just analyzing that last sentence demonstrates
how powerful formal symbolic language can be. Whole logic systems
spring to life when we resort to setting symbols to things and
ideas. And so computing has been called <i>the manipulation of symbols</i>.
</p>

<p>
Here&rsquo;s a quote from math logician Raymond M. Smullyan&rsquo;s book <i>The Tao
Is Silent</i><label id='fnr.10' for='fnr-in.10.8006679' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>10</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.10.8006679' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>10</sup>
Now, is Professor Smullyan saying ignorance is bliss?
</span>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The knowledge of the ancients was perfect. How perfect? I will tell
you. At first they did not yet know that there were things. This is
the most perfect knowledge; nothing can be added. Next they knew
things but did not yet make distinctions between them. Next they made
distinctions between them but did not yet pass judgements upon
them. When judgement was passed, Tao was destroyed. With the
destruction of Tao, individual preferences come into being.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Yes, the rabbit hole of language and symbolism goes deep. But let&rsquo;s
come back to what is meant by a symbol in the computer
world. Basically, a symbol in a computer language represents a place
in the computer&rsquo;s live memory.
