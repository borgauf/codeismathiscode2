* Existence and uniqueness

Tom Apostol is being higher-math formal when he speaks of
**existence** and **uniqueness** in the context of the real number
system for calculus. But why do we need so much theory just to add two
numbers and trust that an answer, a /unique/ answer exists? That's our
intuitive human side talking, based on years of building up working
assumptions we've never had to explain or back up with solid
facts. Really? Can't we just go with $2 + 2$ is $4$ and leave it at
that? Point taken, but on this math holiday we're take a first look at
existence and uniqueness formally. And in this whirlwind tour we'll
gain some insight into the higher math way of seeing things, uncover
strange twists, correct some misconceptions.

We continue with our overarching theme, /formalize to operationalize/,
minding /logical entailment/ connections as we go, i.e., this is
/derived/ from that; this /implies/ that. /Derived from/ and /implies
that/ are the modus operandi of higher math. We'll start by talking
about what **binary operations** are in a higher math sense, but just
a beginner version scraping the surface, leaving a more thorough
investigation for later. Again, this is meant to be a math
holiday. Try to follow along, mindful that full development of all the
themes touched on follows...

**Binary operation --- the simple definition**

Let's start with a short, working definition: @@html:<font color =
"#0d3db3">@@A /binary operation/ is any operation performed on /two/
things.@@html:</font>@@ That sounds easy enough. The basic operations
in arithmetic are binary; **[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition][Addition]]**[fn:1] is a binary
operation. But wait, in grade school didn't we add big columns, rows
of numbers? Yes and no. Technically speaking, you added /two/ numbers,
got an answer, then added the next number to that /augend/
answer---repeating until everything was totalled up.[fn:2]

-----

** 1. Addition as a /function/

Higher mathematics has a more general, universal view of
addition. @@html:<font color = "#0d3db3">@@Addition is a **function**
that takes an /ordered pair/ of numbers and maps them to a single
result@@html:</font>@@. Why a pair? Again, addition is a __binary__,
two-inputs operation.[fn:3]

As mentioned earlier, functions in higher math have a more exacting
definition, which originates in set theory, and, yes, the definition
above is talking in terms of set theory. But for now we'll just be
tourists...

Let's look at an example from the programming world, specifically from
the programming language [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)][Lisp]] that might help us understand addition
as a function. In Lisp addition looks like this: ~(+ 2 2)~. What you
see is a Lisp **list**, really nothing more than things listed inside
of parentheses. In Lisp /the first element of a list is always
considered a function/, while the elements after the function are the
function's input variables, e.g., the list ~(func a b)~ has the
function ~func~ taking as input ~a~ and ~b~. Again, Lisp programs are
just lists and only lists, hence, our example ~(+ 2 2)~ can be
considered an entire Lisp program. So to Lisp ~+~ is truly a function
in the higher-math sense. Now, how could we write ~(+ a b)~, i.e.,
adding two numbers together, as a standard algebra function? /In order
to take two input numbers to add, we would need **two** independent
variables/, e.g., $f(x,y) = x + y$.

What was your first exposure to functions? Most students first
/graphed/ functions, e.g., $f(x) = x^2$, on a two-dimensional
Cartesian coordinate system plane.[fn:4] We bring this up to contrast
a function, $f(x) = y$, to be graphed on a 2-D plane with a binary
function $g(x,y) = z$. Now does $g(x,y) = z$ have dimensionality? Can
we think of any binary operation, $g(x,y) = z$, in a geometric way
like when we graph $f(x) = y$? Hold that thought,
we're coming right back...

Now that we know a little Lisp, what would this Lisp code do, ~(+ 1
2 3 4)~? Yes, it would be just like adding up a column of four numbers
like you did in grade school, and it should give ~10~.

\begin{align*}
  & 1 \\[-3pt]
  & 2 \\[-3pt]
  & 3 \\[-3pt]
  +& 4 \\
  \hline
  &\!\! 10
\end{align*}

Again, let's ask what an algebra function for adding this list of
numbers would look like. To add up any /four/ numbers let's try

\begin{align*}
h(w,x,y,z) = w + x + y + z
\end{align*}

Good, but now we're being held to exactly /four/ independent input
variables, i.e., the function $h$ would only work for adding a /four/
number column. Don't we really need something more general, more
flexible that can take a list, a column of numbers of any size and add
them? ... But wait, at this point we seem to be at odds with the rule
that addition is binary, i.e., that addition can take only two numbers
at a time.

If Lisp holds strictly to addition is a binary operation, it would
need a way to add the first /two/ numbers of a longer list, save
(accumulate) that /augend/, then add the next number, update the
accumulator---doing this over and over until done. However, our Lisp
code, ~(+ 1 2 3 4)~, at least on the face of it, doesn't seem to offer
a way. How is Lisp's ~+~ function even defined? Obviously, if we're
holding to addition is binary we need some way to repeat, cycle,
iterate until we have everything added to give a final answer. Indeed,
this is what /recursion/ is about, probably the biggest concept in
computing. For our Lisp **form**,[fn:5] ~(+ 1 2 3 4)~, consider this
rewrite: ~(+ (+ (+ 1 2) 3) 4)~. At least visually, this makes addition
binary again, no?  With parentheses we can group /addends/ into
pairs. And yes, Lisp parentheses work just like algebra's---from the
deepest nesting outward. Behind the scenes, Lisp's ~+~ function must
be doing something just like this heavily-parenthesized version.[fn:6]
We'll see how later...

** Exists and unique details

Back to Apostol who makes our two main points about addition:
- **Exists:** For every /pair/ $(x, y)$ of numbers being added, $x +
  y$, there is an answer, i.e., /a result exists/...
- **Well-defined:** ...and this guaranteed result is **unique**, i.e.,
  you will never perform $x + y$ and get two different answers.

All right, so if we take a /pair/ of numbers and add them---we get a
result, and this result is unique. Again, this seems just too obvious
to take serious. But higher math needs to be exact. This is all for
the sake of logical entailment: @@html:<font color =
"#0d3db3">@@Uniqueness in this sense is tied directly to the binary
operation of addition being a /function/ and functions only allowing
/one/ unique answer to a given input.@@html:</font>@@

Think back when it was forbidden to graph a /vertical/ line on a
Cartesian plane. Why? Because a vertical line fails the so-called
/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_line_test][Vertical Line Test]]/.[fn:7] Why? Once again, because we must hold to
the rule that plugging in any $x$ to a function can only result in
one, single $y$. Even if we can envision a vertical line, say, at
$x=4$ on the graph, $(4,y)$, i.e., $y$ with more than one value, your
algebra teacher didn't allow this. Odd, no? So we might draw a
vertical line on the xy-plane---but it's not supposed to be
there?[fn:8] One common reason given is /the **[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope][slope]]** of a vertical
line cannot be ascertained/. Remember how slope is "rise over run,"
$\frac{\Delta{y}}{\Delta{x}}$. With a vertical line we have the undefined
situation $m = \frac{\Delta{y}}{0}$. Pure logical entailment here...[fn:9]

Realize, however, that the /pair/ $(x,y)$ we're talking about with
addition is /not/ meant as an actual /point/ on a Cartesian coordinate
system plane to be graphed, but as an abstract point in an abstract
plane. We'll completely dissect this soon, but let's continue here by
looking at an example in Haskell code that might shed some light on
this subtle difference

#+name: 72a2e984-b68f-4c7a-8301-55eb9f6d119e
#+begin_src haskell :results verbatim :exports both
[(x, y) | x <- [1, 2, 3], y <- ["red", "blue", "green"]]
#+end_src

When we "evaluate"[fn:10] this code we get

#+RESULTS: 72a2e984-b68f-4c7a-8301-55eb9f6d119e
: [(1,"red"),(1,"blue"),(1,"green"),(2,"red"),(2,"blue"),(2,"green"),(3,"red"),(3,"blue"),(3,"green")]

which is /every possible combination into pairs of the two lists./
Now, does this represent a plane? Attempting to see this
geometrically, this Haskell /list comprehension/ produces four pairs
or, possibly, "points" in this abstract plane where one axis was just
three discrete, separate things $1$ and $2$ and $3$, and the other
(perpendicular?) axis was, again, just three discrete things
$\text{red}$ and $\text{blue}$ and $\text{green}$. Let's see how the
Haskell code above would be expressed in mathematical /set
notation/[fn:11]

\begin{align*}
\{ (x, y) \mid x \in \{1, 2, 3\}, \; y \in \{\text{red}, \text{blue}, \text{green}\} \}
\end{align*}

Translating into English, @@html:<font color = "#0d3db3">@@the /set/
of all possible pairs $(x,y)$ such that the first, $x$, comes from the
set $\{1,2,3\}$ and the second, $y$, comes from the set $\{\text{red},
\text{blue}, \text{green}\}$@@html:</font>@@.[fn:12] In both versions,
Haskell code and set notation, we see our /pair/, our /tuple/, and
indeed it is: ~[(x,y) |...~ and $\{ (x, y) \mid x\ldots$. We
also see Haskell represents sets as /lists/, only that Haskell lists
are contained in square brackets ~[ ]~.

Let's get back to the issue of comparing your algebra exposure of
plotting functions in the xy-plane to the Haskell code that produces
all possible combinations of the lists ~[1, 2, 3]~ and ~["red",
"blue", "green"]~. When you studied algebra, pre-calculus, and
calculus, you were always in the realm of real numbers,
$\mathbb{R}$. And as we'll see when we formally define numbers, real
numbers can be plotted on a one-dimensional line geometrically as a
**continuous** on that line with no gaps. Not so with ~[1, 2, 3]~ and
~["red", "blue", "green"]~. These are two lists, each containing three
**discrete**, separate elements.  And another big difference between
the list ~["red","blue","green"]~ and the real number line---bBesides
the former being a very short list of discrete elements and the latter
being a list of infinite elements---is /there can be no sense of
**distance** between, say, ~"red"~ and ~"blue"~/. What's more, how do
we know which comes before the other?  However, with a geometrical
real number line we have both the concept of distance between two
elements, as well as which comes before which. Establishing the rules
of order is a big deal in higher math.

What would happen if we tried to run the Haskell code above to create
all possible combinations/pairs of the real numbers with the real
numbers?[fn:13] /It would run endlessly/. Why? Because a Cartesian
plane is a smooth, continuous surface, and trying to generate the
infinite number of points on the plane would be impossible. Just like
the real number line smooth, continuous because it is so absolutely
dense, so is the plane envisioned spanned by two real number lines set
perpendicular.


** Dipping a toe into set theory

Let's follow some of the logical entailment about a vertical
line[fn:14] on a graph. As we'll soon explore, there are functions
(strict) and there are /relations/ (looser). Strangely enough, some
pre-calculus texts do go into basic set theory and the difference
between a /relation/ and a /function/. However, at that level they
typically hand-wave. The exception is Stitz and Zeager's /[[https://www.stitz-zeager.com/szprecalculus07042013.pdf][Precalculus]]/
which states

@@html:<font color = "#0d3db3">@@A **relation** is a set of points in
the plane, and a **function** is a **relation** restricted to that set
of points which represent a mapping of some number in the /domain/ to
only one number in the /range/.@@html:</font>@@

So if Stitz and Zeager say a /relation/ is a set of /points/ in a 2-D
__plane__, realize that

- "Points" are represented by pairs of numbers where...
- ...the first number is a place on the x-coordinate axis, the second
  a place on the y-coordinate axis

Now let's grab their definition of /domain/ and /range/

@@html:<font color = "#0d3db3">@@ Suppose $F$ is a /relation/ which
describes $y$ as a /function/ of $x$

- The set of the x-coordinates of the points in $F$ is called the
  **domain** of $F$.
- The set of the y-coordinates of the points in $F$ is called the
  **range** of $F$.  
@@html:</font>@@

Stitz and Zeager are giving a set theory definition without having
given a high-math version of set theory. But let's try to unpack
this. The /relation/ $F$ is being restricted to being a /function/,
which we might simply rename $f(x) = y$. But then why call it a
relation $F$?  Because speaking in terms of relations is more
higher-math formal and general. Realize a function is a more narrow
type of relation. For example, in a 2-D plane the points $(5,4)$,
$(5,5)$, $(5,6)$, and $(5,7)$ might describe the /relation/ $A$, but
$A$ could not be a /function/ because $5$ from the x-axis is /related/
to more than one number from the y-axis. However, the relation $H$
might be described by points $(4,4), $(5,6)$, and $(7,10)$, where no
$x$ is related to more than one $y$.

A pair $(x,y)$ is also called a /tuple/. As we've mentioned, you
probably first saw pairs or tuples of numbers as identifying points
plotted on graphs, i.e., the first number, the /x-coordinate/
represents a place on the x-axis and the second number the
/y-coordinate/ a place on the y-axis, and taken together, a point on
the two-dimensional plane. Of course, the order is important. But for
Apostol the tuple is more abstracted. A tuple is the result of a
function which /pairs/ together, or **maps** one set of numbers (from
the domain) to another set of numbers (to the range). Yes, $f(x) =
x^2$ is a little factory that /makes/ squares of numbers; but seen
from set theory, @@html:<font color = "#0d3db3">@@$f(x) = x^2$ is
taking a number from the /set/ of real numbers and /mapping/
(connecting, joining, pointing, pairing, looping back to) another
number of that same real number set.@@html:</font>@@

#+begin_figure
#+CAPTION: $f(x) = x^2$ maps from one place on the real number line to another.
[[file:images/realnumber3to9.png]]
#+end_figure


A binary operation, such as adding $3$ and $2$ together, would have
the tuple $(3,2)$, the first and second numbers /both/ coming from the
set of all real numbers $\mathbb{R}$---just like in the picture
above. That is, addition in the higher math world is a binary
operation that "maps" a tuple, $(a,b)$, through addition to another
real number.

\begin{align}
(a,b) \mapsto a + b
\end{align}

Stare at (1) a bit. Mull over the above wording. But then let's back
up to plotting points on a plane from algebra. The typical expression
when graphing was $f(x) = y$, e.g., $f(x) = x^2$, or, confusingly, $y
= x^2$ for plotting a parabola. Be mindful that we're dealing with an
x-dimension and a y-dimension of a 2-dimensional plane. Now, how is
this different from our first stab at an algebra function for adding
two numbers, i.e., $g(x,y) = x + y$? The problem lies with the fact
that $f(x) = y$ is /not/ mapping $x$ /and/ $y$ to a new unique $z$. We
are not doing $z = g(x,y); instead, a function like $f(x) = x^2$ is
/mapping/ the $x$ value to a $y$ value. This is actually /not/ a
binary operation, rather, a **unary** operation, i.e., a /single/
variable is being mapped to a value. Hence, with our new notation
$f(x) = x^2$ would be $f: x \mapsto x^2$. Yes, a Cartesian coordinate
system is working with pairs, i.e., each point is $(x,y)$, but in
reality the pairs are actually $(x,f(x))$ since $y = f(x)$. Recapping,
in our new notation we will see

\begin{align} f &: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}, \;where\; x \mapsto x^2 \\
g &: \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}, \;where\; (x,y) \mapsto x + y = z \end{align}

Again, we'll cover this in depth later, but $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \rightarrow
\mathbb{R}$ just means we take /two/ numbers from the set of real
numbers and get a /third/ number from the set of real numbers. On the
other hand, $\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ means we take /one/ number from
the set of real numbers and get a /second/ number.


** 2. The Property of Closure

Existence and uniqueness also involve the higher-math concept of
**closure**. For example, if $x$ and $y$ are real numbers, the
/unique/ result $x + y$ is also a member of the set of real
numbers. Seems obvious, no? But it turns out we can't just /assume/
this.

Closure ensures that when we do math like addition we never "fall out
of" or escape the set of real numbers into some other sort of numbers
undefined. In higher-math talk we would say, /The **binary operation**
of addition is **closed** in the set of real numbers/. Again, it just
means when you add real numbers, you get a real number, not some
surprise non-real number. This may seem like the worst of
hair-splitting yet, but consider $\mathbb{N}$, the "natural" counting
numbers $1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots$ Now, we cannot say there is a closure on
binary operation of subtraction, since, e.g., $3 - 4$ gives us a
/negative/ number, i.e., outside the counting numbers, which are
always positive.[fn:15]

** Comparison with Other Operations

To see why uniqueness matters, consider operations that **don't**
always have this property in other contexts:

#+NAME: UETable1
#+ATTR_HTML: :class fullwidth :center nil
| **Operation**            | **Unique in $\mathbb{R}$?** | **Reason**                                 |
| <l>                      | <l>                         | <l>                                        |
| Addition ($x + y$)       | Yes                         | Field Axiom 1                              |
| Multiplication ($xy$)    | Yes                         | Field Axiom 1                              |
| Square Root ($\sqrt{x}$) | No                          | $x^2 = 4$ has two solutions: $2$ and $-2$. |
| Division ($x / y$)       | Mostly                      | Unique /except/ when $y = 0$ (undefined).  |

Yes, the square root highlights how uniqueness must be nailed
down---and it's a common mistake to forget that taking a square root
will produce both a negative and positive possible roots. But then
we're prejudiced toward the /principle/ root, i.e., the positive root,
e.g., $\surd 9 = 3$, while $\sqrt{9} = \pm3$.[fn:16]


** 3. Why bother stating such obvious things?

Because it sets the stage for proving everything else. /Higher math
attacks our hazy, prejudiced, inexact assumptions with rigor/. Without
the guarantee of uniqueness:

- **Substitution would fail:** If $x + y$ could be two different things, you couldn't reliably replace $x + y$ with a single value in an equation.
- **Equivalence would break:** We couldn't say $a = b \implies a + c = b + c$ with absolute certainty.

Later we'll tackle one the most basic sets of laws in mathematics,
namely **Peano's Axioms**[fn:17] and how everything builds up from
that. As we mentioned in the preface, this is all about /logical
entailment/, which is invariably what computers need. Mathematics
eventually explained in ironclad detail exactly why, e.g., addition
works --- /addition is a logical consequence of how sets
interact/. Another way to say this is, /addition is an **artefact** of
set interaction/, which is definitely more mysterious. Even worse,
Grok says: /Addition is the canonical binary operation satisfying the
group axioms on the set/. This is a long way from just doing
arithmetic in grade school with pencil and paper. Before we're
through, we'll understand what all this means. As an assignment, use
this AI prompt to ask:

#+begin_quote
Einstein supposedly said "Gravity is an **artefact** of space-time geometry." Can you explain this?
#+end_quote

When we get better at abstraction, we're well on our way to
understanding why math formalism meshes so well with computer
operationalization.

* Footnotes

[fn:1] Maybe glance over the Wikipedia article linked to read up on
some of the details about addition.

[fn:2] Sometimes we speak of the /augend/ as an **accumulator** held
in memory. This touches on the /recursive/ nature of math lurking in
so many places. We'll have /lots/ of fun with recursion later.

[fn:3] Addition and multiplication are commutative, i.e., which order
your add or multiply doesn't matter, but obviously order matters with
subtraction and division. We'll discuss later why we still insist on
ordered pairs at a later point.

[fn:4] [[file:images/Cartesian-coordinate-system.png]] \\
Cartesian plane (sometimes called /Euclidean plane/ or the /xy-plane/) with marked points
(signed ordered pairs of coordinates). For any point, the **abscissa**
is the first value ($x$ coordinate), and the **ordinate** is the
second value ($y$ coordinate). Hence, each pair is $(x,y)$ or $(x,
f(x))$.

[fn:5] A **form** refers to any valid piece of code (an expression)
that can be evaluated by the language's evaluator to produce a
value. We'll get into detail about what an expression in the math
world is later.

[fn:6] It looks like we started from the left of the list of elements
and worked our way two at a time to the right. But we could have
started from the right and gone left. Perhaps write down how the
parentheses would look computing right-to-left. Could one be better
than the other?

[fn:7] Geometrically described, The VLT says, A curve in the xy-plane
is the graph of a function of $x$ if and only if no vertical line
intersects the curve more than once. (See the image in the Preface.)

[fn:8] Is there any "legal" way to draw a vertical line on a graph?
Turns out yes. One way is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_equation][parametric equations]], which you might have
seen in precalculus or calculus.

[fn:9] In the same spirit, which came first, the rule "a negative
times a negative is a positive" or the Distributive Property of
binomials? Consider $7 \cdot 7 = 49$. We could rewrite this as $(9 -
2)(9 - 2) = 49$, no? But then expanding according to the square of
differences, $(a-b)^2 = a^2 -2ab + b^2$, we have $81 - 2(18) + (-2 \cdot
-2)$ giving $45 + (-2 \cdot -2)$. Now, to get $49$ we must have $(-2 \cdot -2)
= 4$. Is this "proof" of a negative times a negative is a positive?
Welcome to the land of logical entailment...

[fn:10] Fancy but exact way of saying /run/ the code. Haskell isn't
/running/ code, it is /evaluating expressions/. Details later...

[fn:11] Don't worry, we'll go into detail about set theory and its set
notation shorthand soon. Just try to read it.

[fn:12]  The math symbol for "in" or "of" is $\in$, i.e., $x \in \{1,2\}$
means $x$ in the set $\{1,2\}$. Haskell duplicates this visually with
~<-~.

[fn:13] How was a Cartesian plane "created" back when you first
encountered them? Typically, it magically appeared when you drew one
solid line which geometrically represented the real numbers laid
horizontal. It was named the x-axis; then duplicated that real number
line, laid it perpendicular to the x-axis and called y-axis. Then we
would imagine the paper itself as the 2-D plane /spanned/ by the
x-and-y axes. So we didn't actually have to /generate/ all possible
combinations of the first set of real numbers and the second set---we
just imagine it happened...  Soon we'll explain this bit of
hand-waving with set theory.

[fn:15] We will explore the different types of numbers (natural,
integer, rational, real, complex) and not just assume real numbers as
does high school algebra and calculus.

[fn:16] There is a great example of why we should /not/ be
mathematically prejudiced toward positive roots behind the story of
how we discovered antimatter. See [[https://youtu.be/Y-W-w8yNiKU?si=FX2T2AAXycOGegnf][The Man Who Accidentally Discovered

[fn:17] Imagine you meet seemingly advanced aliens who just landed in a
fancy space ship. You start communications by writing numbers on a
board, $1,2,3,\ldots$, and they eventually understand, but smirk and
act dismissive. Confused, you ask them to explain how they do simple
numbers, "So tell us how you would represent $3$." They write on the
board $3 = S(S(S(0)))$. They explain that $S$ is a /successor/
function that gives you "the next number," starting with $S(0) = 1$
... the aliens are using Peano's numbering. Soon...
