* Math Holiday: Existence and uniqueness

Tom Apostol is being higher-math formal when he speaks of
**existence** and **uniqueness** in the context of the real number
system for calculus. But then $2 + 2$ gives $4$, right? Why do we need
so much theory just to add two numbers and trust that an answer, a
/unique/ answer exists? That's our intuitive human side talking, based
on years of assuming things we've never had to explain or back up with
solid facts. On this math holiday we'll take a first look at existence
and uniqueness explained formally. And in this whirlwind tour we'll
gain more insight into the higher math way of seeing things, uncover
strange twists, correct some misconceptions. We continue with our
overarching theme, /formalize to operationalize/, highlighting
/logical entailment/consequence/ connections as we go, You'll see
"this is /derived/ from that, this /implies/ that" over and
over. /Derived from/ and /implies that/ are the modus operandi of
higher math. **[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory][Set theory]]** is ultimately what's behind all of this
and the bedrock of higher math. We'll warm up by talking about what a
**binary operation** is in a higher math sense, which fans out into
much logical entailment and rabbit-holing. But this will be just a
beginner version scraping the surface, leaving a more thorough
investigation, again, based in set theory, for later. This is meant to
be a math holiday. Try to follow along, mindful that full development
of all the themes touched on follows...

**Binary operation --- the simple definition**

What is a /binary operation/? Let's start with a short, working
definition: @@html:<font color = "#0d3db3">@@A /binary operation/ is
any operation performed on /two/ things.@@html:</font>@@ That sounds
easy enough. The basic operations in arithmetic---**[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition][addition]]**[fn:1],
subtraction, multiplication, division---are binary. But wait, in grade
school didn't we add big columns, rows of numbers? Yes and
no. Technically speaking, you added /two/ numbers, got an answer, then
added the next number to that /augend/ answer---repeating until
everything was totalled up.[fn:2] This was done /operationally/ by
starting with the ones column, carrying over to the tens column,
etc.... This makes addition a good example of theory versus practice
typical of computer studies.

-----

** 1. Addition as a /function/

Addition has a formal, general definition in higher
mathematics. @@html:<font color = "#0d3db3">@@Addition is a
**function** that takes an /ordered pair/ of numbers and **[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_(mathematics)][maps]]** them
to a single result.@@html:</font>@@[fn:3]

- Addition is a __binary__ operation: /two/ inputs housed as an
  ordered pair.
- Addition is a function: /only/ one unique output. 

As mentioned earlier, functions in higher math have a more exacting
definition, and, yes, the definition above is steeped in set
theory. But for this math holiday we'll just be set theory tourists...

Let's look at an example from the programming world, specifically from
the programming language [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)][Lisp]], that might help us understand addition
as a function. In Lisp addition looks like this: ~(+ a b)~ where $a$
and $b$ are addable things like numbers. What you see is a Lisp
**list**, really nothing more than things, officially called
/elements/, listed left-to-right inside of parentheses. It couldn't be
simpler. In Lisp /the first element of a list is always considered a
function/, while the elements after the function are the function's
input variables, e.g., the list ~(func a b)~ has the function ~func~
taking as input ~a~ and ~b~. Again, Lisp programs are just lists and
only lists, hence, the example ~(+ 2 2)~ can be considered an entire
Lisp program. So to Lisp ~+~ is a function in the higher-math
sense. Now, how could we write ~(+ a b)~ as a standard algebra
function? /In order to take two input numbers to add, we would need
**two** independent variables/, e.g., $g(x,y) = x + y$.

What was your first exposure to functions? Most students first
/graphed/ functions, e.g., $f(x) = x^2$, on a two-dimensional
Cartesian coordinate system plane.[fn:4] We bring this up in order to
contrast a function $f(x) = y$ graphed on a 2D plane with a binary
function $g(x,y) = z$. Now, does $g(x,y) = z$ have dimensionality? Can
we think of any binary operation, $g(x,y) = z$, in a geometric way
like when we graph $f(x) = y$? Hold that thought, we're coming right
back...

Since we now know a little Lisp, what would this code do, ~(+ 1 2 3
4)~? Yes, it would be just like adding up a column of four numbers
like you did in grade school, and it should give ~10~

\begin{align*}
  & 1 \\[-3pt]
  & 2 \\[-3pt]
  & 3 \\[-3pt]
  +& 4 \\
  \hline
  &\!\! 10
\end{align*}

Again, let's ask what an algebra function for adding this list of
numbers would look like. To add up any /four/ numbers let's try

\begin{align*}
h(w,x,y,z) = w + x + y + z
\end{align*}

Good, but now we're being held to exactly /four/ independent input
variables, i.e., the function $h$ would only work for adding a /four/
number column. Don't we really need something more general, more
flexible that can take a list, a column of numbers of any size and add
them? ... But wait, aren't we at odds with the rule that addition is
binary, i.e., that addition can take only two numbers at a time?

If Lisp holds strictly to addition is a binary operation, it would
need a way to add the first /two/ numbers of a longer list, save
(accumulate) that /augend/, then add the next number, update the
accumulator---doing this over and over until done. However, our Lisp
code, ~(+ 1 2 3 4)~, at least on the face of it, doesn't seem to offer
a way. How is Lisp's ~+~ function even defined internally? Obviously,
if we insist addition is binary we need some way to repeat, cycle,
iterate until we have everything added to give a final answer. Again,
this is what /recursion/ is about, probably the biggest concept in
computing. For our Lisp **form**,[fn:5] ~(+ 1 2 3 4)~, consider this
rewrite: ~(+ (+ (+ 1 2) 3) 4)~. At least visually, this makes addition
binary again, no?  With parentheses we can group /addends/ into
pairs.[fn:6] And yes, Lisp parentheses work just like
algebra's---start with the deepest nesting and work (simplify)
outward. Doesn't this mean that behind the scenes Lisp's ~+~ function
is doing something just like this heavily-parenthesized version?[fn:7]
We'll see how later...

** More exists and unique details

Back to Apostol who makes two main points about addition:
- **Exists:** For every /pair/ $(x, y)$ of numbers being added, $x +
  y$, there is an answer, i.e., /a result exists/...
- **Well-defined:** ...and this guaranteed result is **unique**, i.e.,
  you will never perform $x + y$ and get two different answers.

By the way, does $x + y$ represent, /symbolize/ the answer gotten by
adding $x$ and $y$, or does $x + y$ represent a process, an engine,
machine, factory that produces an answer? This goes to the heart of
/symbolism/ in math. In the previous paragraph we said, "...you will
never /perform/ $x + y$ and get..." Well, in higher math /$a + b$
symbolizes/ the result. Surprised? Perhaps because $a + b$ /feels/
like the /act/ of adding--you see it, you calculate it---not the
result. But in classical mathematics, the equals sign ($=$) represents
*identity*. When we write: \[ 2 + 2 = 4 \] we are not saying the
/process/ of adding $2$ and $2$ /yields/ $4$. We are actually saying,
the entity $2 + 2$ **is** the entity $4$. So, while $a + b$ /denotes/
the result, it /connotes/ the structure or process of combining
them. /Is-ness/ in math is a big deal.

To demonstrate once again how /formalize to operationalize/ is at
play, in a computer language like Lisp the expression $a + b$ can be
/symbolized/ by an **[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree][abstract syntax tree]] (AST)**.[fn:8]

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
                  (+)
                 /   \
               (a)   (b)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Three aspects:

- **The Tree:** The symbol $+$ is the /root/ node, and $a$ and $b$ are
  the /leaves/ ... of an upside-down tree, that is.
- **The Redex:** In Lambda Calculus,[fn:9] $a+b$ is called a /redex/
  or a /reducible expression/ (think rewriting). Here an addition form
  is seen as a /potential for calculation/.
- **The Normal Form:** The result (the single number) is the /normal
  form/ where no more work can be done, i.e., no more reducing.

All right, so if we take a /pair/ of numbers and add them---we get a
result, and this result is unique! Again, this seems too obvious to
get so theoretical about it. But higher math needs to be exact. And
here is once again our most important logical entailment: @@html:<font
color = "#0d3db3">@@Uniqueness is tied directly to, come from the
binary operation of addition being a /function/ and functions only
allowing /one/ unique answer to any given input.@@html:</font>@@

Think back when your teacher said it was "forbidden" to graph a
/vertical/ line on a Cartesian plane. Why? Because a vertical line
fails the so-called /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_line_test][Vertical Line Test]]/.[fn:10] Why? Once again,
because we must hold to the rule that plugging in any $x$ to a
function can only result in one, single $y$. This, once again, is just
another way of saying we need a /unique/ answer. Even if we can
envision a vertical line, say, at $x=4$ on the graph, e.g., $(4,y)$,
where $y$ has more than one value, your algebra teacher didn't allow
this. Odd, no? Wait... So we can physically draw a vertical line on
the xy-plane---but it's not supposed to be there?[fn:11] No, and one
common reason given is /the **[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope][slope]]** of a vertical line cannot be
ascertained/. Remember how slope is "rise over run,"
$\frac{\Delta{y}}{\Delta{x}}$. But with a vertical line we have no "run", no
change of x. We have the __undefined__ situation $m =
\frac{\Delta{y}}{0}$. Again, $x$ is not moving. Pure logical entailment
here...[fn:12]

One fun way of seeing why we can't have a vertical line in the real
world is to consider a graph of time versus distance---something
moving in time, as is common in so many physics situations. In the
diagram below we see that at precisely time equals $4$ seconds the
distance seems to have jumped to many different locations
instantaneously in addition to distance equals $4$ meters, i.e., a
quasi-teleportation from science fiction.

** Abstracting pairs

Realize, however, that the /pair/ $(a,b)$ we're talking about with
addition should /not/ be confused with a /point/ graphed on a
Cartesian coordinate system plane, rather, as an /abstract/ point in
an /abstract/ plane. We'll completely dissect this soon, but let's
continue here by looking at an example in Haskell code that might
start to shed some light on this subtle difference

#+name: e815b542-e31a-4432-9723-d2b7e2e854ab
#+begin_src haskell :results verbatim :exports both
[(ns, cs) | ns <- [1, 2, 3], cs <- ["red", "blue", "green"]]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: e815b542-e31a-4432-9723-d2b7e2e854ab
: [(1,"red"),(1,"blue"),(1,"green"),(2,"red"),(2,"blue"),(2,"green"),(3,"red"),(3,"blue"),(3,"green")]

When we "evaluate"[fn:13] this code we get back /every possible
combination of the two lists, ~ns~ and ~cs~, as pairs./[fn:14] Now,
does this represent an actual plane?  Attempting to see this
geometrically, our Haskell /list comprehension/ produces nine pairs
or, possibly, "points" in this abstract plane where one axis is made
up of just three discrete, separate things, $1$ and $2$ and $3$, and
the other (perpendicular?) axis is, likewise, just three discrete
things, $\text{red}$ and $\text{blue}$ and $\text{green}$. Let's see
how the Haskell code above would be expressed in mathematical
/set-builder notation/[fn:15]

\begin{align*}
\{ (ns, cs) \mid ns \in \{1, 2, 3\}, \; cs \in \{\text{red}, \text{blue}, \text{green}\} \}
\end{align*}

Translating into English, @@html:<font color = "#0d3db3">@@the /set/
of all possible pairs $(ns,cs)$ such that $ns$ comes from the set
$\{1,2,3\}$ and $cs$ comes from the set $\{\text{red}, \text{blue},
\text{green}\}$@@html:</font>@@.[fn:16] In both versions, Haskell code
and set notation, we can see our /pair/, our /tuple/, and indeed it is
~[(ns,cs) |...~ as well as $\{ (ns, cs) \mid x\ldots$. We also see
Haskell represents sets as /lists/, only that Haskell lists are
contained in square brackets ~[ ]~ and not parentheses like Lisp.

Let's get back to the issue of comparing your algebra exposure of
plotting functions in the xy-plane to the Haskell code that produces
all possible /combinations/ of the lists ~[1, 2, 3]~ and ~["red",
"blue", "green"]~. How are these two things related? When you studied
algebra, pre-calculus, and calculus, you were always in the realm of
real numbers, $\mathbb{R}$, whether it was specifically mentioned or
not. And as we'll see when we formally define numbers, /real numbers
can be geometrically represented as a one-dimensional line/ since real
numbers are so dense, one after the other. This property makes them
essentially **continuous** with no gaps.[fn:17],[fn:18]

Not so with ~[1, 2, 3]~ and ~["red", "blue", "green"]~. These two sets
(here given as Haskell lists) each contain only three **discrete**,
separate elements, while the set real numbers is endless and
infinite. And another big difference between the list
~["red","blue","green"]~ versus the real number line is /there can be
no sense of **distance between**, say, ~"red"~ and ~"blue"~/. What's
more, how do we know which comes before the other?  However, with a
geometrical real number line, we have both the concept of distance
between two elements, as well as which comes before
which. Establishing the rules of order is a big deal in higher math.

What would happen if we tried to run the Haskell code above to create
all possible combinations/pairs of the real numbers with the real
numbers? In other words, what if we tried to create an xy-plane by
listing out all the pairs of $x$ and $y$ making up that plane? /It
would run endlessly/. Why? Because a Cartesian plane is a smooth,
continuous surface, and trying to generate the infinite number of
points of even the tiniest section of the plane would be
impossible. Just like the real number line is smooth and continuous
because it is infinite, dense, and complete, so too is the plane
envisioned, /spanned/ by two real number lines set perpendicular.

Question: How was Cartesian-Euclidean plane created back when you
first encountered them? Typically, they magically appeared when you

1. drew a solid, horizontal line geometrically representing the real
   numbers. It was named the x-axis, then,
2. drew another real number line perpendicular to the x-axis and
   called it the y-axis,
3. then you imagined the paper itself as the 2D plane created,
   /spanned/ by these xy-axes.

Once again, we didn't actually have to /generate/ all possible
combinations of the first set of real numbers and the second set,
i.e., all points on the plane---we just imagined it happening... Soon
we'll explain this bit of hand-waving with set theory.

** Dipping a toe into set theory after all

Let's sort out some more of the logical entailment about a vertical
line[fn:19] on a graph. As we'll soon explore more deeply when we deal
with spaces and planes in set theory, there are functions (strict) and
there are /relations/ (looser). Strangely enough, some pre-calculus
texts do enter set theory by talking about the difference between a
/relation/ and a /function/. However, at that level they're typically
hand-waving. Somewhat of an exception is Stitz and Zeager's (S&Z)
/[[https://www.stitz-zeager.com/szprecalculus07042013.pdf][Precalculus]]/ which states outright

@@html:<font color = "#0d3db3">@@A **relation** is a set of points in
the plane, and a **function** is a **relation** restricted to that set
of points representing a mapping of some number in the function's
/domain/ to only one number in the /range/.@@html:</font>@@

One problem in mathematics is reading something like this...and not
realizing how much logical consequence is lurking in the words. With
such a statement we must read between the lines---quite a bit. So
let's unpack this. First, S&Z are restricting the discussion to the 2D
plane. And since this is Pre-calculus, they're assuming real
numbers. Then they describe a /function/ as a more specific, exacting
type of /relation/. So when they say a /relation/ is a set of /points/
in a 2D __plane__, realize that

- "Points" are represented by __pairs__ of real numbers where...
- ...the first number is a place on the x-coordinate axis, the second
  a place on the y-coordinate axis

...just like when we plotted coordinates when graphing a function. So
yes, S&Z are talking higher math, but they're also keeping things
centered in the pre-calculus world of real number functions graphed on
the 2D Cartesian coordinate system. Now let's consider their
definition of /domain/ and /range/

@@html:<font color = "#0d3db3">@@ Suppose $F$ is a /relation/ which
describes $y$ as a /function/ of $x$, i.e., $y = f(x)$

- The set of x-coordinates (the first numbers of the points) is called
  the **domain** of $F$.
- The set of y-coordinates (the second numbers of the points) is
  called the **range** of $F$.
@@html:</font>@@

Let's translate this. First, they're talking set theory when they base
things in terms of /sets/, but at this point let's stay beginner-naive
and consider a set as just a grouping or list. Next, the /relation/
$F$ is restricted to being a /function/, which is also referred to as
$f(x) = y$. But then why call it a relation $F$? Because speaking in
terms of relations is more higher-math formal and generalized. And so,
a function is a narrower type, a /subset/ of a relation. For example,
let's imagine we have in a 2D plane a /relation/ labeled as $A$, and
$A$ is made up of the points $(5,4)$, $(5,5)$, $(5,6)$, and
$(5,7)$. This is a valid relation. Why? Because as the definition of a
relation simply states: /A relation is a set of points in the plane/,
and that means literally /any/ grouping of points. But can $A$ be a
function? No, because $5$ from the x-axis is /related/ to more than
one number from the y-axis, i.e., one input is being paired with
different outputs.[fn:20] But what about, e.g., the relation $H =
\{(4,4), (5,6), (7,10)\}$, where no $x$ is related to more than one
$y$?[fn:21]

A pair $(a,b)$ is also called a **[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple][tuple]]**, a more general, abstract
concept with lots of logical entailment we'll soon explore. Order is a
central feature of tuples, e.g., $(4,9)$ and $(9,4)$ are two different
places on a plane. In the case of a function, a tuple is the result of
pairing together, or **mapping** one set of numbers (from the domain)
to another set of numbers (to the range). Yes, $f(x) = x^2$ is a
little factory that makes squares of numbers, and yes, we can graph
$f$ (a concave-up parabola with a vertex of $0$); but as described by
higher math @@html:<font color = "#0d3db3">@@$f(x) = x^2$ takes a
number from the /set/ of real numbers and /maps/ (connects, joins,
points, pairs) it to another number of that same real number
set.@@html:</font>@@ In this case, one /set/ of real numbers
$\mathbb{R}$ /contains/ both the domain and the range, though we
imagine $\mathbb{R}$ as quasi-duplicated. We'll talk about this
containment below...

#+begin_figure
#+CAPTION: $f(x) = x^2$ maps one place on the number line to another.
[[file:images/realnumber3to9.png]]
#+end_figure


A binary operation, on the other hand, such as adding $2$ and $3$
together, would have the tuple $(2,3)$ --- the first and second
numbers coming from the quasi-duplicated set of all real numbers
$\mathbb{R}$ spanning a theoretical plane --- with a result $5$
seemingly on a third real number axis.

#+begin_figure
#+CAPTION: $c = a + b$ represented in 3D.
[[file:images/additionmapping.png]]
#+end_figure

But then this representation is also valid, no?

#+begin_figure
#+CAPTION: $c = a + b$ represented on a single number line.
[[file:images/addbinary.png]]
#+end_figure

How can it be both? Later, we'll be able to clear up the ambiguity
about how binary operations seem to involve /three/ dimensions, while
not really leaving one dimension when we learn about **[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product][Cartesian
products]]** in the context of set theory. Specific to this discussion,
we'll learn how the /domain/ of addition is the abstract space
$\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$. Yes, a lot was left out when you first
learned about graphing functions in Algebra.

As we've said, addition in the higher math world is a binary operation
that "maps" a tuple, $(a,b)$, with the addition /function/ to another
(single!) number. Below is one way higher math symbolizes this

\begin{align}
{\large+} : \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}, (a,b) \mapsto a + b
\end{align}

Stare at (1) a bit. Mull over the above wording. The $\mathbb{R} \times
\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ part is just the Cartesian product
designation telling us we're mapping from a Cartesian product space of
real numbers ($\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$) back into the real numbers
($\mathbb{R}$). Notice the symbol $\mapsto$ which means "maps to."
This is about emphasizing how the pair $(a,b)$ is transformed into,
mapped to the output $a + b$.  Now, how would we depict $f(x) = x^2$
in this new way?[fn:22] Consider

\begin{align}
x^y : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}, (x) \mapsto x^2
\end{align}

This is actually /not/ a binary operation, rather, a **[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unary_operation][unary
operation]]**, i.e., a /single/ variable is being mapped to a value. Yes,
a Cartesian coordinate system is working with pairs, i.e., each point
is $(x,y)$, but in reality the pairs are $(x,f(x))$ since $y =
f(x)$.

Again, we'll cover all this in depth later. Consider yourself slightly
exposed to set theory.

** 2. The Property of Closure

Existence and uniqueness also involve the higher-math concept of
**[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(mathematics)][closure]]**. We were just talking about how if $x$ and $y$ are real
numbers, the /unique/ result $x + y$ is also a member of the set of
real numbers. This seems obvious, no? But it turns out we can't just
/assume/ this.

Closure ensures that when we do math such as addition we never "fall
out of" or escape the set of real numbers into some other sort of
numbers or places undefined. In higher-math talk we would say, /The
**binary operation** of addition is **closed** in the set of real
numbers/. Again, it just means when you add real numbers, you get a
real number, not some surprise non-real number. This may seem like the
worst of hair-splitting yet, but consider $\mathbb{N}$, the "natural"
counting numbers $1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots$ Now, we cannot say there is a
closure on the binary operation of subtraction, since, e.g., $3 - 4$
gives us a /negative/ number, i.e., outside the counting numbers,
which are always positive.[fn:23]

** Comparison with Other Operations

To see why uniqueness matters, consider operations that **don't**
always have this property in other contexts:

#+NAME: UETable1
#+ATTR_HTML: :class fullwidth :center nil
| **Operation**            | **Unique in $\mathbb{R}$?** | **Reason**                                 |

| Multiplication ($xy$)    | Yes                         | Field Axiom 1                              |
| Square Root ($\sqrt{x}$) | No                          | $x^2 = 4$ has two solutions: $2$ and $-2$. |
| Division ($x / y$)       | Mostly                      | Unique /except/ when $y = 0$ (undefined).  |

Yes, the square root highlights how uniqueness must be nailed
down---and it's a common mistake to forget that taking a square root
will produce both a negative and positive possible roots. But then
we're prejudiced toward the /principle/ root, i.e., the positive root,
e.g., $\surd 9 = 3$, while $\sqrt{9} = \pm3$.[fn:24]


** 3. Why bother stating such obvious things?

Because it sets the stage for proving more important things
later. /Higher math attacks our hazy, prejudiced, inexact assumptions
with rigor/. For example, without the guarantee of uniqueness:

- **Substitution would fail:** If $x + y$ could be two different
  things, you couldn't reliably replace $x + y$ with a single value in
  an equation.
- **Equivalence would break:** We couldn't say $a = b \implies a + c =
  b + c$ with absolute certainty.

Remember we said equals, $=$, is more about /identity/ than
/yields/.

We've scratched a lot of surface here, played the tourist on holiday,
had some loose conversations with the local denizens, sampled a lot of
odd, new math cuisine. We touched on how /relations/ are more general,
and, thus, forgiving than functions. So why not represent phenomena as
just relations?  Later when we really dive into relations, but for now
we'll say relations are just too loose. Modern science is built on
Calculus, and Calculus is the study of how things change. To define a
rate of change (a derivative), you need a clear "before" and "after."
If you look at a curve that loops back on itself as a relation, and
you pick an $x$ where the curve has two points (two $y$'s), the
concept of "slope" becomes ambiguous. Which point are we talking
about? Which direction is "forward"? By restricting ourselves to
functions, we ensure that for every input, there is a single,
unambiguous value, slope, and area. This allows us to build the
machinery of differentiation and integration without constantly
hitting logical forks in the road.

Also later we'll tackle one the most basic laws in mathematics, namely
**Peano's Axioms**[fn:25] and how everything builds up from that. As
we keep saying, this is all about /logical entailment/, which is
invariably what needs minding. Mathematics has explained in ironclad
detail exactly why, e.g., addition works --- /addition is a logical
consequence of how sets interact/. Another fancy way to say this is,
/addition is an **artefact** of set interaction/, which is definitely
more mysterious. For example, Grok says: /Addition is the canonical
binary operation satisfying the group axioms on the set/.[fn:26] Yes,
this is a long way from just doing arithmetic in grade school with
pencil and paper. As a /Gendankenexperiment/ or thought experiment,
use this prompt to ask an AI chatbot:

#+begin_quote
Einstein supposedly said "Gravity is an **artefact** of space-time geometry." Can you explain this?
#+end_quote

When we get more familiar with abstraction, we'll understand better
why math formalism meshes so well with computer operationalization.

* Footnotes

[fn:1] Maybe glance over the Wikipedia article linked to read up on
some of the details about addition.

[fn:2] Sometimes we speak of the /augend/ as an **accumulator** held
in some form of memory---your brain's or a computer's memory. This
touches on the /recursive/ nature of math lurking in so many
places. We'll have /lots/ of fun with recursion later.

[fn:3] /Ordered/ pair? Addition and multiplication are commutative,
i.e., which order your add or multiply doesn't matter, i.e., input
$(a,b)$ gets the same output as $(b,a)$. But obviously order matters
with subtraction and division. We'll get back to why we still insist
on ordered pairs at a later point. Hint: You have to start with order
to have $(a,b) = (b,a)$ make any sense, no?. But there's a deeper
reason we'll see later.

[fn:4] [[file:images/Cartesian-coordinate-system.png]] \\
Cartesian plane (sometimes called /Euclidean plane/ or the /xy-plane/) with marked points
(signed ordered pairs of coordinates). For any point, the **abscissa**
is the first value ($x$ coordinate), and the **ordinate** is the
second value ($y$ coordinate). Hence, each pair is $(x,y)$ or $(x,
f(x))$.

[fn:5] A **form** refers to any valid piece of code (an expression)
that can be evaluated by the language's evaluator to produce a
result. We'll get into detail about what an expression is in the math
world later.

[fn:6] Addition is **[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_property][associative]]**, this basic law allows our
parentheses groupings.

[fn:7] It looks like we started from the left of the list of elements
and worked our way two at a time to the right. But we could have
started from the right and gone left. Perhaps write down how the
parentheses would look computing right-to-left. Could one be better
than the other?

[fn:8] Perhaps skim the Wiki article. Lots more about AST, a subset of
graph theory in the future.

[fn:9] The so-called **[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus][Lambda Calculus]]** is the basis of functional
programming languages like the Lisp and the ML family. Lots more to
come!

[fn:10] Geometrically described, The VLT says, A curve in the xy-plane
is the /true graph of a function of $x$/ if and only if no vertical line
intersects the curve more than once. (See the image in the Preface.)

[fn:11] Is there any "legal" way to draw a vertical line on a graph?
Turns out yes. One way is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_equation][parametric equations]], which you might have
seen in pre-calculus or calculus.

[fn:12] In the same spirit, which came first, the rule "a negative
times a negative is a positive" or the Distributive Property of
binomials? Consider $7 \cdot 7 = 49$. We could rewrite this as $(9 -
2)(9 - 2) = 49$, no? But then expanding according to the square of
differences, $(a-b)^2 = a^2 -2ab + b^2$, we have $81 - 2(18) + (-2 \cdot
-2)$ giving $45 + (-2 \cdot -2)$. Now, to get $49$ we must have $(-2 \cdot -2)
= 4$. Does this "prove" that a negative times a negative is a
positive?

[fn:13] In math, functions and variable are typically one-letter long,
e.g., $a, b, c, \ldots x, y, z$ while in programming they can be many
letters, often descriptive. Here we mean ~ns~ for /numbers/ and ~cs~
for /colors/.

[fn:14] This code is a self-contained, one-line Haskell form called a
**[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_comprehension][list comprehension]]**, analogous to a **[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-builder_notation][set
comprehension]]**. Lots more Haskell to come.

[fn:15] Don't worry, we'll go into detail about set theory's
/set-builder notation/, another name for /set comprehensions/,
soon. Just try to read it.

[fn:16]  A set is typically housed inside of curly brackets $\{\; \}$;
the pipe $\mid$ means "such that"; and $\in$ is the symbol for
"contained in" or "is an element of," i.e., $x \in \mathbb{N}$ means $x$
from/in the set of all counting numbers. Haskell duplicates $\in$
with ~<-~.

[fn:17] Imagine a large ball covered in ink rolling on a flat
surface. The ball would effectively produce an unbroken line. Now,
imagine a cog with teeth, the teeth inked and rolling on that flat
surface. This would produce spots or /points/ on the surface as it
rolled along.

[fn:18] Is there a connection between /continuous/ and /infinite/
vis-a-vis the real numbers? Did a math teacher ever show you why
$0.999... = 1.0$? This has to do with **[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completeness_of_the_real_numbers][completeness]]**. Yes, you need
/infinite/ points to make a line. Yes, you need /density/, or
seemingly endless points between points. Completeness simply means
that /if you are able to seemingly approach a spot arbitrarily
closely, then an actual point must exist there/. So getting endlessly
close to $1.0$ by carrying out $0.999\ldots$ to huge places is indeed
$1.0$. Now, why would completeness be necessary when we want to call a
straight, continuous-as-unbroken line an accurate representation of
the real numbers?

[fn:19] ...or any curvy, loopy thing failing the VLT...

[fn:20] Doesn't this imply that yes, we can have a vertical line on a
2D plane as a /relation/, just not as a function?

[fn:21] Quick aside: Could we consider the relation that is also a
function $H$ to be a **[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piecewise_function][piecewise function]]** since it would look like
just points on a plane-like backdrop, i.e., not a smooth line or
curve?  No, because a /piecewise/ function is typically just a stack
of separate functions bundled together as one function. (See the
Wikipedia article examples.) $H$, however, has a very limited domain
of the /set/ $\{4,5,7\}$ and range $\{4,6,10\}$. Like the Haskell
example above, we have /discrete/ elements and not continuous like the
set $\mathbb{R}$ of real numbers with infinite elements.

[fn:22] Note, variable symbols $a, b, \ldots x, y$ are
interchangeable as long as they're used consistently. And yes, there's
a formal, higher math way of stating this...

[fn:23] We will explore the different types of numbers (natural,
integer, rational, real, complex) and not just assume real numbers as
does high school algebra and calculus.

[fn:24] There is a great example of why we should /not/ be
mathematically prejudiced toward positive roots behind the story of
how we discovered antimatter. See [[https://youtu.be/Y-W-w8yNiKU?si=FX2T2AAXycOGegnf][The Man Who Accidentally Discovered
Antimatter]].

[fn:25] Imagine you meet seemingly advanced aliens who just landed in
a fancy space ship. You start communications by writing numbers on a
board, $1,2,3,\ldots$, and they eventually understand, but smirk and
act dismissive. Confused, you ask them to explain how they do simple
numbers, "So tell us how you would represent $3$." They write on the
board $3 = S(S(S(0)))$. They explain that $S$ is a /successor/
function that gives you "the next number," starting with $S(0) = 1$
... the aliens are using Peano's numbering and recursion. Yes, soon...

[fn:26] **Canonical** has a consequential high math meaning as well...
