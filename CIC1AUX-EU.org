* Existence and uniqueness

Apostol is leaning into the foundational /Existence and Uniqueness/
property of the real number system. While it might seem like common
sense—of course $2 + 3$ is $5$ --- in the context of Tom Apostol’s
rigorous approach, this statement is the first step in defining
**Binary Operations** --- which we'll explore soon.

By starting here, Apostol is establishing the **Field Axioms**.

-----

** 1. Addition and Multiplication as Functions

In higher mathematics, we view addition ($+$) and multiplication ($\cdot$)
as **functions** that take an ordered pair of real numbers and map
them to a single result. As mentioned earlier, functions in higher
math have a more exacting definition which we'll only briefly touch
here.

Apostol is essentially saying:[fn:1], [fn:2]
- **Binary Operation:** For every pair $(x, y)$ --- or in regular
  arithmetic $x + y$ --- there is a result.
- **Well-defined:** The result is **unique**. You will never perform
  $x + y$ and get two different answers.

** 2. The Property of Closure

This assumption also implies **closure**. If $x$ and $y$ are real
numbers, the /unique/ result $x + y$ is also a member of the set of
real numbers. This ensures that when we do algebra we never "fall out
of" or escape the set of real numbers into something undefined. In
fancy math talk, /the **binary operation** of addition is **closed**
in the set of real numbers/. Again, it just means when you add
real numbers, you get a real number, not some surprise non-real
number. This may seem the worst of hair-splitting, but consider
$\mathbb{N}$, the "natural" counting numbers $1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots$ Now,
we cannot say there is a closure on binary operation of subtraction,
since, e.g., $3 - 4$ is a /negative/ number, i.e., outside the
counting numbers, which are always positive.

**Comparison with Other Operations**

To see why uniqueness matters, consider operations that **don't**
always have this property in other contexts:

#+NAME: UETable1
#+ATTR_HTML: :class fullwidth :center nil
| **Operation**            | **Unique in $\mathbb{R}$?** | **Reason**                                 |
| <l>                      | <l>                         | <l>                                        |
| Addition ($x + y$)       | Yes                         | Field Axiom 1                              |
| Multiplication ($xy$)    | Yes                         | Field Axiom 1                              |
| Square Root ($\sqrt{x}$) | No                          | $x^2 = 4$ has two solutions: $2$ and $-2$. |
| Division ($x / y$)       | Mostly                      | Unique /except/ when $y = 0$ (undefined).  |


** 3. Why Bother Stating the Obvious?

It sets the stage for proving everything else. Without the guarantee
of uniqueness:

- **Substitution would fail:** If $x + y$ could be two different things, you couldn't reliably replace $x + y$ with a single value in an equation.
- **Equivalence would break:** We couldn't say $a = b \implies a + c = b + c$ with absolute certainty.

Later we'll get into the most basic laws of arithmetic, namely
**Peano's Axioms**[fn:3] and how everything builds up from that. As we
mentioned in the preface, this is all about /logical entailment/,
which is invariably what computers need. Mathematics eventually
explained in ironclad detail exactly why, e.g., addition works ---
/addition is a logical consequence of how sets interact/. Another way
to say this is, /addition is an **artefact** of set interaction/,
which is more mysterious. Think about what this could mean. As an AI
prompt ask:

Einstein supposedly said "Gravity is an artefact of space-time geometry." Can you explain this?

* Footnotes

[fn:1] Quickly described, a **binary operation** is any operation on
/two/ things. Yes, but in grade school we added a whole column of
numbers. No, you didn't. Technically, you added two numbers, got an
answer, then added the next number to that /augend/ answer---over and
over. This touches on the /recursive/ nature of math lurking in so
many places. We'll have /lots/ more fun with recursion later. (Perhaps
see the Wikipedia on **[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition][Addition]]** for more detail about why adding is
a binary operation.)

[fn:2] Don't worry about the /tuple/ $(x,y)$. You've seen pairs
(tuples) as points plotted on graphs, i.e., the first number
represents the x-axis and the second number the y-axis. Here the tuple
refers to the higher-math definition of a function where, as in the
algebra graph example, a **function** /pairs/ a number from the x-axis
with a number from the y-axis. A binary operation like adding $3$ and $2$
would be represented as $(3,2)$.

[fn:3] Imagine you meet seemingly advanced aliens who just landed in a
fancy space ship. You start communications by writing numbers on a
board, $1,2,3,\ldots$, and they eventually understand, but smirk and
act dismissive. Confused, you ask them to explain how they do simple
numbers, "So tell us what how you would represent $3$." They write on
the board $3 = S(S(S(0)))$. They explain that $S$ is a /successor/
function that gives you "the next number," starting with $S(0) = 1$
... this is the basis of Peano established. Soon...
