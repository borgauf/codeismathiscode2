when it came out in its first edition as <i>The Little Lisper</i> based on
the programming language Lisp in 1987. Subsequent editions switched to

This Socratic dialog explores in its chatty conversation style a sort
of loose <i>mathematical formalism</i><label id='fnr.2' for='fnr-in.2.8263294' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.2.8263294' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup>
Go <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formalism_(philosophy_of_mathematics)">here</a> to see the Wikipedia discussion about mathematic
formalism&#x2014;although it&rsquo;s a bit formal&#x2026;
</span> where you the reader will
experience a growing mental structure of theory and syntax as the
conversation continues and the pages turn. Instead of making direct
statements about programming language syntax rules, we experience a
stream of questions that will have us gradually form the facts in our
own minds. We&rsquo;re if effect <i>backing into</i> Scheme programming and its
underlying philosophy&#x2014;and underlying is quite a bit.
</p>

<p>
Some things, however, are directly stated. Even before the first
chapter entitled <i>1. Toys</i>, there are listed (jokingly named?) <i>The
Ten Commandments</i>, followed by <i>The Five Rules</i>. Again, this is a nod
to, a play on the mathematical formalism of an <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_system">axiomatic system</a></i>
&#x2026; which is a great departure from most &ldquo;learn to code&rdquo; books where
syntax rules are stated, examples given&#x2014;then you start writing code
that does stuff. How exactly is TLS different? Right from the start
the vast underlying theory of computing is hinted at, gradually,
carefully brought into focus. &ldquo;Learn to code,&rdquo; on the other hand,
hardly ever worries about the theory behind it all, concentrating
instead on &ldquo;getting stuff done.&rdquo; TLS isn&rsquo;t in the least concerned with
&ldquo;getting stuff done.&rdquo;  To be sure, we have chosen TLS because it lends
itself so well to jumping off into the important underlying concepts
of computer science.
</p>

<p>
The first axiomatic system is generally accepted as being the
multi-volume set collectively called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#Axioms">Euclid&rsquo;s Elements</a> (EE) from
ca. 300 BC. EE was once a staple of Junior year high school math
&#x2026; though highly dreaded, as it was the student&rsquo;s first exposure to
<i>proving</i> instead of just doing math. Proving something in math
requires a deep grasp of a topic, which is completely different from
the typical style of stimulus-response <i>conditioning</i>, e.g., &ldquo;when you
see this, do this&rdquo; training. Starting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#Axioms">Euclidean Geometry</a>, the
student is asked to see a geometric situation<label id='fnr.3' for='fnr-in.3.4017446' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.3.4017446' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup>
For example the (in)famous <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pons_asinorum">pons asinorum</a></i> in <i>Euclid&rsquo;s
Elements</i> <br>
<img src="images/Byrne_pons_asinorum.jpg" alt="Byrne_pons_asinorum.jpg"> <br>
where it is <i>proven</i> that indeed the angles opposite the equal sides
of an isosceles triangle are themselves equal.
</span> and understand why
something about it is <i>necessarily</i> (proven to be) true. A proof of,
e.g., the <i>pons asinorum</i> is a step-by-step establishing of facts
based on Euclid&rsquo;s <i>Postulates</i> and <i>Notions</i>. This was, as many would
say, the beginning of modern mathematics where a set of axioms could
be called on to build <i>theorems</i>, i.e., additional true
assumptions. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_system">Axioms</a> go by many names, e.g., basic truths, givens,
primitives. Here are Euclid&rsquo;s five postulates
</p>


<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>P1</dt><dd>A straight line may be drawn between any two points.</dd>
<dt>P2</dt><dd>Any terminated straight line may be extended indefinitely.</dd>
<dt>P3</dt><dd>A circle may be drawn with any given point as center and any
given radius.</dd>
<dt>P4</dt><dd>All right angles are equal.</dd>
<dt>P5</dt><dd>Through a given point \(P\) not on a line \(L\), there is one and
only one line in the plane of \(P\) and \(L\) which does not meet \(L\).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The last postulate is a more modern rewording of the original meaning
<i>truly parallel lines may exist that never cross</i>. To these first
five, Euclid added another five basic truths, his <i>Common Notions</i>
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>N1</dt><dd>Things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to
each other.</dd>
<dt>N2</dt><dd>If equals are added to equals, the wholes are equal.</dd>
<dt>N3</dt><dd>If equals are subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal.</dd>
<dt>N4</dt><dd>Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another.</dd>
<dt>N5</dt><dd>The whole is greater than the part.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
With these ten axiomatic statements begins much geometry, logic,
number and set theory. That is to say, great amounts of <i>implication</i>,
&ldquo;if this then that&rdquo; can be derived from these ten accepted
givens.<label id='fnr.4' for='fnr-in.4.4849930' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>4</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.4.4849930' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>4</sup>
In mathematical logic the idea of <i>implication</i> is very
fundamental. Something <i>implies</i> something else; because \(A\), that
means \(B\) as well. Implication goes by many names: <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_conditional">material
conditional</a></i>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_ponens">modus ponens</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_consequence">logical consequence</a>. We first see
implication in programming with the basic <i>if-then-else</i> conditional.
</span> For example, N5 would seem to say something almost
silly trivial. But as <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/elements/bookI/cn.html">this treatment</a> explains N5 is introducing in
odd wording the basic concept of one thing being larger than another,
i.e., \(A>B\). Here&rsquo;s David E. Joyce&rsquo;s, professor of mathematics at Clark
University, explanation
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
To say one magnitude \(B\) is a part of another \(A\) could be taken as
saying that \(A\) is the sum of \(B\) and \(C\) for some third magnitude
\(C\), the remainder. Symbolically, \(A > B\) means that there is some \(C\)
such that \(A = B + C\).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Again, to the novice this may look like nit-picking, but real math
comes from having these basic foundational givens&#x2014;upon which new,
useful math is solidly, logically built. Higher math<label id='fnr.5' for='fnr-in.5.8791831' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>5</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.5.8791831' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>5</sup>
<i>Higher math</i> in the U.S. typically means those math topics
pursued in the junior and senior year of a Bachelors math degree,
i.e., those courses <i>after</i> Calculus, Differential Equations, and
Linear Algebra.
</span> is the
realm of axiomatic math where proofs of <i>theorems</i> are the
staple. Higher math is where the student becomes a real mathematician
who looks under the hood and learns what makes things tick.
</p>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s look at a more serious-seeming set of axioms, again from course
material by Professor Joyce, then a proof of a theorem based, relying
on these axioms
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Vector addition is <i>commutative</i>: \(v + w = w + v\).</li>
<li>Vector addition is <i>associative</i>: \((u + v) + w = u + (v + w)\).</li>
<li>There is a vector, denoted \(0\) such that \(v + 0 = v = 0 + v\).</li>
<li>For each \(v\), there is another vector \(−v\) such that \(v + (−v) =
   0\).</li>
<li>Scalar multiplication <i>distributes</i> over vector addition: \(c(v + w) =
   cv + cw\).</li>
<li>Scalar multiplication <i>distributes</i> over real addition: \((c + d)v = cv + dv\)</li>
<li>Multiplication and scalar multiplication <i>associate</i>: \(c(dv) =
   (cd)v\).</li>
<li>The number \(1\) acts as <i>identity</i> for scalar multiplication: \(1v
   = v\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
These axioms are taken from Linear Algebra. And now we&rsquo;ll prove a very
basic theorem relying on these axiom truths
</p>

<p>
<font color = "#650d1c">
Theorem: \(0v = 0\)
</font>
</p>

<p>
&#x2026;or zero times a vector \(v\) is zero.
</p>

<p>
<font color = "#650d1c">Proof: </font> Since \(0 +
0 = 0\), therefore \((0 + 0)v = 0v\). By axiom <b>6</b>, that implies \(0v + 0v
= 0v\). If we could subtract \(0v\) from each side, we’d be done, but
subtraction isn’t yet defined. Still, we can add the negation of \(0v\)
to each side which should accomplish about the same thing. Thus,
</p>

\begin{align*}
(0v + 0v) + (−0v) = 0v + (−0v).
\end{align*}

<p>
Next, we can associate the paretheses differently by axiom <b>2</b> to get
</p>

\begin{align*}
0v + (0v + (−0v)) = 0v + (−0v).
\end{align*}

<p>
That equation simplifies by axiom <b>4</b> to \(0v + 0 = 0\), and by axiom
<b>3</b>, that further simplifies to \(0v = 0\) which is what was to be
proved. <b>Q.E.D.</b><label id='fnr.6' for='fnr-in.6.6439167' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>6</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.6.6439167' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>6</sup>
&#x2026; <i>quod erat demonstrandum</i>, meaning &ldquo;that which was to be
demonstrated&rdquo;.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Got it? No worries (yet) if you didn&rsquo;t. The point is to understand
that this so-call higher math thing wants to be built solidly on
logical, provable facts. But yes, it&rsquo;s a strange world for the
beginner who is so used to the usual &ldquo;get stuff calculated&rdquo; math. In
algebra we never needed to show that an entity times zero is zero. So
yes, here we have a thorough proof of something that we normally would
have taken for granted. But again, so is the high math world.<label id='fnr.7' for='fnr-in.7.7675764' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>7</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.7.7675764' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>7</sup>
Go ahead and take a &ldquo;math holiday&rdquo; by touring <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/elements/bookI/cn.html">this page</a> by
Professor Joyce. He speaks from a quasi-set theory standpoint, but
remember, Euclid was talking strictly about geometric shapes. Set
theory had not been invented yet&#x2026;

<h3 id="org94dc380">Axiomatic Scheme</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org94dc380">
<p>
And now we will list out the TLS&rsquo;s version of axiomatic givens
starting with <i>The Ten Commandments</i>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>First Commandment</b>: When recurring on a list of atoms, <code>lat</code>, ask two
questions about it <code>(null? lat)</code> and <code>else</code>; when recurring on a
number, <code>n</code>, ask two questions about it: <code>(zero? n)</code> and <code>else</code>;
when recurring on a list of S-expressions, <code>l</code>, ask three question
about it: <code>(null?  l)</code>, <code>(atom? ( car l))</code>, and <code>else</code>.</li>
<li><b>Second Commandment</b>: Use <code>cons</code> to build lists.</li>
<li><b>Third Commandment</b>: When building a list, describe the first typical
element, and then <code>cons</code> it onto the natural recursion.</li>
<li><b>Fourth Commandment</b>: Always change at least one argument while
recurring. When recurring on a list of atoms, <code>lat</code>, use <code>(cdr
  lat)</code>. When recurring on a number, <code>n</code>, use <code>(sub1 n)</code>. And when
recurring on a list of S-expressions, <code>l</code>, use <code>(car l)</code> and <code>(cdr
  l)</code> if neither <code>(null? l)</code> nor <code>(atom? (car l))</code> are true. [One
argument] must be changed to be closer to termination. The changing
argument must be tested in the termination condition: When using
<code>cdr</code>, test termination with <code>null?</code> and when using <code>sub1</code>, test
termination with <code>zero?</code>.</li>
<li><b>Fifth Commandment</b>: When building a value with \(+\), always use \(0\)
for the value of the terminating line, for adding \(0\) does not
change the value of an addition.</li>
<li><b>Sixth Commandment</b>: Simplify only after the function is correct.</li>
<li><b>Seventh Commandment</b>: Recur on the <i>subparts</i> that are of the same
nature: on the sublists of a list; on the subexpressions of an
arithmetic expression.</li>
<li><b>Eighth Commandment</b>: Use help functions to abstract from
representations.</li>
<li><b>Ninth Commandment</b>: Abstract common patterns with a new function.</li>
<li><b>Tenth Commandment</b>: Build functions to collect more than one value at
a time.</li>
</ul>

<p>
But wait there&rsquo;s more. Next are the <i>The Five Rules</i>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>The Law of <code>car</code></b>: The primitive <code>car</code> is defined only for nonempty
lists.</li>
<li><b>The Law of <code>cdr</code></b>: The primitive <code>cdr</code> is defined only for nonempty
lists. The <code>cdr</code> of any nonempty list is always another list.</li>
<li><b>The Law of <code>cons</code></b>: The primitive <code>cons</code> takes two arguments. The
second argument to <code>cons</code> must be a list. The result is a list.</li>
<li><b>The Law of <code>null?</code></b>: The primitive <code>null?</code> is defined only for lists.</li>
<li><b>The Law of <code>eq?</code></b>: The primitive <code>eq?</code> takes two arguments. Each must
be a non-numeric atom.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Not many among us can take these fifteen axioms and know exactly how
to write a Scheme program.<label id='fnr.8' for='fnr-in.8.3919073' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>8</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.8.3919073' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>8</sup>
Precisely none of us since key things are still missing.
</span> But then if you&rsquo;ve read and
understood a textbook such as <i><a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~gill/BWLectSite/Resources/LDGbookCOV.pdf">Lists, Decisions and Graphs&#x2026;</a></i> by
Edward Bender and S. Gill Williamson, you should be able to catch on
that these axioms are attempting is to create some sort of
omnibus<label id='fnr.9' for='fnr-in.9.7474389' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>9</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.9.7474389' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>9</sup>
&#x2026;containing or including many items. 
</span> <i>list processing</i> machinery. In fact Scheme&rsquo;s
predecessor, Lisp, is an acronym for &ldquo;list processing,&rdquo; because this
is essentially what Lisp and Scheme do, i.e., they do computing tasks
with lists. Really?! How then? Read on.
</p>

<p>
So what is a list? Well, we all know in the everyday sense what a list
is. A grocery list is a good example
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>eggs</li>
<li>milk</li>
<li>flour</li>
<li>potatoes</li>
<li>butter</li>
</ul>

<p>
But we have a problem&#x2014;at least in the math world. That&rsquo;s because
there are also <i>sets</i>. So what is the difference between a list and a
set? To the layman they might seem interchangeable. So many <i>Set
Theory</i> books begin with the statement, <font color =
"#0d3db3"> A set is collections of things. </font> Which is
kind of what a list is too.  But to CS and math people they are
different. Our grocery <i>list</i> is not technically a list because, in
the CS/math world at least, a list is defined as having a specific
order. Think of a <i>string</i> of letters like you&rsquo;re reading right
now. In real life a string of alphabet characters is definitely a list
because <i>the order of the individual letters (and spaces in between)
&#x2014;is everything</i>. We call strings of letters and spaces sentences
&#x2026; where all the sentences in English are made up of differing
combinations of the twenty-six letters (times two if we consider
upper- and lower-case), ten numerals, punctuation, and the space
character. So again, that &ldquo;grocery list&rdquo; is really a set&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
&#x2026;but then we might not call it a set either because sets allow
duplicates. Really? Yes and no. &#x2026;although the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality">cardinality</a></i>
of a set, i.e., its count of elements, only counts the unique
elements, not duplicates. For example, the set \(A = \{1,1,1,2,2\}\) is
identical to \(B = \{1, 2\}\). This can be explained in a few ways. The
easiest is to realize that sets can built from <i>unions</i> and this is
because
</p>


<p>
Sure, we can change the order of the &ldquo;grocery list,&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s start using Scheme syntax to denote lists. So the grocery list
above would look like this in Scheme:

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme" id="orgbec9ad4">
