This Socratic dialog explores in its chatty conversation style a sort
of loose <i>mathematical formalism</i> <label id='fnr.2' for='fnr-in.2.8263294' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.2.8263294' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup>
Go <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formalism_(philosophy_of_mathematics)">here</a> to see the Wikipedia discussion about mathematic
formalism&#x2014;although it&rsquo;s a bit formal&#x2026;
</span> where you the reader will
experience a growing mental picture of theory and syntax as the
conversation continues and the pages turn. Instead of making direct
statements about programming language syntax rules, we get a stream of
questions and replies that will gradually form the desired world in
our own minds. We&rsquo;re if effect <i>backing into</i> Scheme programming and
its underlying philosophy&#x2014;and underlying is quite a bit of computer
science.
</p>

<p>
Some things, however, are directly stated. Before the first chapter
entitled <i>1. Toys</i>, even before the title page, there are listed
(jokingly named?) <i>The Ten Commandments</i>, followed by <i>The Five
Rules</i>. Again, this is a nod to, a play on the mathematical formalism
of an <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_system">axiomatic system</a></i>. But what do we mean by an axiomatic system
and why are they important?
</p>

<p>
The multi-volume set <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#Axioms">Euclid&rsquo;s Elements</a> (EE) from ca. 300 BC Greece is
generally accepted as being the first example of mathematics built on
axioms and proofs. EE has been in the Western world&rsquo;s math curricula
ever since. It was once a staple of high school math &#x2026; <i>though often
dreaded</i>, as it was the student&rsquo;s first exposure to the strange idea
of <i>proving</i> math instead of just doing math. Proving something in
math requires a deep grasp of a topic, which is completely different
from the typical style of &ldquo;when you see this, do this&rdquo;
conditioning. Starting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#Axioms">Euclidean Geometry</a>, the student is asked
to see a geometric situation<label id='fnr.3' for='fnr-in.3.4017446' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.3.4017446' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup>
For example the (in)famous <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pons_asinorum">pons asinorum</a></i> in <i>Euclid&rsquo;s
Elements</i> <br>
<img src="images/Byrne_pons_asinorum.jpg" alt="Byrne_pons_asinorum.jpg"> <br>
where it is <i>proven</i> that indeed the angles opposite the equal sides
of an isosceles triangle are themselves equal.
</span> and understand why something about
it is <i>necessarily</i> (proven to be) true. The proof of, e.g., the <i>pons
asinorum</i> is a step-by-step establishing of facts based on Euclid&rsquo;s
<i>Postulates</i> and <i>Notions</i>. Again, this was the beginning of modern
mathematics where a set of axioms could be called on to build
<i>theorems</i>, i.e., additional true assumptions. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_system">Axioms</a> go by many
names, e.g., basic truths, givens, primitives. Here are Euclid&rsquo;s five
postulates
</p>


<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>P1</dt><dd>A straight line may be drawn between any two points.</dd>
<dt>P2</dt><dd>Any terminated straight line may be extended indefinitely.</dd>
<dt>P3</dt><dd>A circle may be drawn with any given point as center and any
given radius.</dd>
<dt>P4</dt><dd>All right angles are equal.</dd>
<dt>P5</dt><dd>Through a given point \(P\) not on a line \(L\), there is one and
only one line in the plane of \(P\) and \(L\) which does not meet \(L\).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The last postulate is a more modern rewording of the original meaning
<i>truly parallel lines may exist that never cross</i>. To these first
five, Euclid added another five basic truths, his <i>Common Notions</i>
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>N1</dt><dd>Things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to
each other.</dd>
<dt>N2</dt><dd>If equals are added to equals, the wholes are equal.</dd>
<dt>N3</dt><dd>If equals are subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal.</dd>
<dt>N4</dt><dd>Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another.</dd>
<dt>N5</dt><dd>The whole is greater than the part.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
With these ten axiomatic statements begins much geometry, logic,
number and set theory. That is to say, great amounts of <i>implication</i>,
&ldquo;if this then that&rdquo; can be derived from these ten accepted
givens.<label id='fnr.4' for='fnr-in.4.4849930' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>4</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.4.4849930' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>4</sup>
In mathematical logic the idea of <i>implication</i> is very
fundamental. Something <i>implies</i> something else; because \(A\), that
means \(B\) as well. Implication goes by many names: <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_conditional">material
conditional</a></i>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_ponens">modus ponens</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_consequence">logical consequence</a>. We first see
implication in programming with the basic <i>if-then-else</i> conditional.
</span> For example, the last notion, N5, seems to say
something almost silly and trivial. But as <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/elements/bookI/cn.html">this treatment</a> explains, N5
is introducing in odd wording the basic concept of one thing being
<i>larger</i> than another, i.e., \(A>B\). Here&rsquo;s David E. Joyce&rsquo;s, professor
of mathematics at Clark University, explanation
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
To say one magnitude \(B\) is a part of another \(A\) could be taken as
saying that \(A\) is the sum of \(B\) and \(C\) for some third magnitude
\(C\), the remainder. Symbolically, \(A > B\) means that there is some \(C\)
such that \(A = B + C\).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Again, to the novice this may look like nit-picking, but real math
comes from having these basic foundational givens&#x2014;upon which new,
useful math is solidly, logically built. Higher math<label id='fnr.5' for='fnr-in.5.8791831' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>5</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.5.8791831' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>5</sup>
<i>Higher math</i> in the U.S. typically means those college math
courses pursued in the junior and senior year of a Bachelors math
degree, i.e., those courses <i>after</i> Calculus, Differential Equations,
and Linear Algebra.
</span> is the
realm of axiomatic math where proofs of <i>theorems</i> are the
staple. Higher math is where the student becomes a real mathematician
who looks under the hood and learns what makes things tick.
</p>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s consider a more serious-looking set of axioms, again, taken from
course material by Professor Joyce, then a proof of a theorem based,
relying on these axioms<label id='fnr.6' for='fnr-in.6.6439167' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>6</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.6.6439167' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>6</sup>
These axioms are taken from Linear Algebra.
</span>
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Vector addition is <i>commutative</i>: \(v + w = w + v\).</li>
<li>Vector addition is <i>associative</i>: \((u + v) + w = u + (v + w)\).</li>
<li>There is a vector, denoted \(0\) such that \(v + 0 = v = 0 + v\).</li>
<li>For each \(v\), there is another vector \(−v\) such that \(v + (−v) =
   0\).</li>
<li>Scalar multiplication <i>distributes</i> over vector addition: \(c(v + w) =
   cv + cw\).</li>
<li>Scalar multiplication <i>distributes</i> over real addition: \((c + d)v = cv + dv\)</li>
<li>Multiplication and scalar multiplication <i>associate</i>: \(c(dv) =
   (cd)v\).</li>
<li>The number \(1\) acts as <i>identity</i> for scalar multiplication: \(1v
   = v\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
And now we&rsquo;ll prove a very basic theorem relying on these axiom truths
</p>

<p>
<font color = "#650d1c">
Theorem: \(0v = 0\)
</font>
</p>

<p>
&#x2026;or zero times a vector \(v\) is zero.
</p>

<p>
⌜<br>
<font color = "#650d1c">Proof: </font> Since \(0 + 0
= 0\), therefore we can say \((0 + 0)v = 0v\). By axiom <b>6</b>, that implies
\(0v + 0v = 0v\). If we could subtract \(0v\) from each side, we’d be
done, but subtraction isn’t yet defined. Still, we can add the
negation of \(0v\) to each side which should accomplish about the same
thing. Thus,
</p>

\begin{align*}
(0v + 0v) + (−0v) = 0v + (−0v).
\end{align*}

<p>
Next, we can associate the parentheses differently by axiom <b>2</b> to get
</p>

\begin{align*}
0v + (0v + (−0v)) = 0v + (−0v).
\end{align*}

<p>
That equation simplifies by axiom <b>4</b> to \(0v + 0 = 0\), and by axiom
<b>3</b>, that further simplifies to \(0v = 0\) which is what was to be
proved. <b>Q.E.D.</b><label id='fnr.7' for='fnr-in.7.7675764' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>7</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.7.7675764' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>7</sup>
&#x2026; <i>quod erat demonstrandum</i>, meaning &ldquo;that which was to be
demonstrated&rdquo;.
</span> <br>
⌟
</p>

<p>
Got it? No worries (yet) if you didn&rsquo;t. The point is to understand
that this so-call higher math thing wants to be built exclusively on
axioms. But yes, this is a strange world for the beginner so used to
the usual &ldquo;get stuff calculated&rdquo; math. In algebra we never needed to
show that an entity times zero is zero. So yes, here we have a
thorough proof of something that we normally would have taken for
granted. But again, this is the world of higher math.<label id='fnr.8' for='fnr-in.8.8811130' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>8</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.8.8811130' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>8</sup>
Go ahead and take a &ldquo;math holiday&rdquo; by touring <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/elements/bookI/cn.html">this page</a> by
Professor Joyce. He speaks from a quasi-set theory standpoint, but
remember, Euclid was talking strictly about geometric shapes. Set
theory had not been invented yet&#x2026;

<h3 id="orgb7d0ae3">Axiomatic Scheme</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb7d0ae3">
<p>
And now we will list out the TLS&rsquo;s version of axiomatic givens
starting with <i>The Ten Commandments</i>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>First Commandment</b>: When recurring on a list of atoms, <code>lat</code>, ask two
questions about it <code>(null? lat)</code> and <code>else</code>; when recurring on a
number, <code>n</code>, ask two questions about it: <code>(zero? n)</code> and <code>else</code>;
when recurring on a list of S-expressions, <code>l</code>, ask three question
about it: <code>(null?  l)</code>, <code>(atom? ( car l))</code>, and <code>else</code>.</li>
<li><b>Second Commandment</b>: Use <code>cons</code> to build lists.</li>
<li><b>Third Commandment</b>: When building a list, describe the first typical
element, and then <code>cons</code> it onto the natural recursion.</li>
<li><b>Fourth Commandment</b>: Always change at least one argument while
recurring. When recurring on a list of atoms, <code>lat</code>, use <code>(cdr
  lat)</code>. When recurring on a number, <code>n</code>, use <code>(sub1 n)</code>. And when
recurring on a list of S-expressions, <code>l</code>, use <code>(car l)</code> and <code>(cdr
  l)</code> if neither <code>(null? l)</code> nor <code>(atom? (car l))</code> are true. [One
argument] must be changed to be closer to termination. The changing
argument must be tested in the termination condition: When using
<code>cdr</code>, test termination with <code>null?</code> and when using <code>sub1</code>, test
termination with <code>zero?</code>.</li>
<li><b>Fifth Commandment</b>: When building a value with \(+\), always use \(0\)
for the value of the terminating line, for adding \(0\) does not
change the value of an addition.</li>
<li><b>Sixth Commandment</b>: Simplify only after the function is correct.</li>
<li><b>Seventh Commandment</b>: Recur on the <i>subparts</i> that are of the same
nature: on the sublists of a list; on the subexpressions of an
arithmetic expression.</li>
<li><b>Eighth Commandment</b>: Use help functions to abstract from
representations.</li>
<li><b>Ninth Commandment</b>: Abstract common patterns with a new function.</li>
<li><b>Tenth Commandment</b>: Build functions to collect more than one value at
a time.</li>
</ul>

<p>
But wait there&rsquo;s more. Next are the <i>The Five Rules</i>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>The Law of <code>car</code></b>: The primitive <code>car</code> is defined only for nonempty
lists.</li>
<li><b>The Law of <code>cdr</code></b>: The primitive <code>cdr</code> is defined only for nonempty
lists. The <code>cdr</code> of any nonempty list is always another list.</li>
<li><b>The Law of <code>cons</code></b>: The primitive <code>cons</code> takes two arguments. The
second argument to <code>cons</code> must be a list. The result is a list.</li>
<li><b>The Law of <code>null?</code></b>: The primitive <code>null?</code> is defined only for lists.</li>
<li><b>The Law of <code>eq?</code></b>: The primitive <code>eq?</code> takes two arguments. Each must
be a non-numeric atom.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Not many beginners can take these fifteen axioms and know exactly how
to write a Scheme program.<label id='fnr.9' for='fnr-in.9.7474389' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>9</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.9.7474389' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>9</sup>
Precisely none of us since key things are still missing.
</span> But then if you&rsquo;ve read and
understood a textbook such as <i><a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~gill/BWLectSite/Resources/LDGbookCOV.pdf">Lists, Decisions and Graphs&#x2026;</a></i> by
Edward Bender and S. Gill Williamson, you might catch on that these
axioms are attempting is to create some sort of omnibus<label id='fnr.10' for='fnr-in.10.8006679' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>10</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.10.8006679' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>10</sup>
&#x2026;containing or including many items.
</span> <i>list
processing</i> machinery. In fact Scheme&rsquo;s predecessor, <b>Lisp</b>, is an
acronym for &ldquo;list processing,&rdquo; because this is essentially what Lisp
and Scheme do, i.e., they do computing tasks with lists. Really?! A
whole working programming language is just a bunch of lists? How can
that be? Read on.
</p>

<p>
What then is a list? We all know in the everyday sense what a list
is. A grocery list is a good example
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>eggs</li>
<li>milk</li>
<li>flour</li>
<li>potatoes</li>
<li>butter</li>
</ul>

<p>
But we have a problem&#x2014;at least in the math world. That&rsquo;s because in
mathematics (again, higher math) there are also <i>sets</i>. So what is the
difference between a list and a set? To the layman they might seem
interchangeable. <i>Set theory</i> is the fundamental starting point of
higher math, and so many set theory books begin with the statement 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<font color = "#0d3db3"> <i> A set is collections of
things. </font> </i>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Which is kind of what a list is too.  But to CS and math people they
are two different entities. Our grocery <i>list</i> is not technically a
list because, in the CS/math world at least, <i>a list is defined as
having a specific order</i>. But then our grocery list could be in any
order, doesn&rsquo;t really matter.
</p>

<p>
Order matters. Let&rsquo;s think of a <i>string</i> of letters like you&rsquo;re
reading right now. In real life a string of alphanumeric characters is
definitely like a list because <i>the order of the individual
alphanumeric characters (and spaces in between) &#x2014;is everything. You
can&rsquo;t mix them up</i>. We call strings of letters and spaces <i>sentences</i>
&#x2026; where all the sentences in English are made up of differing
combinations of the twenty-six letters (times two if we consider
upper- and lower-case), the ten numerals, punctuation, and the space
character. So again, that &ldquo;grocery list&rdquo; is really a <i>set</i> of
groceries&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
&#x2026;but then we might not call it a set either because sets allow
duplicates. Really? Yes and no. &#x2026;although the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality">cardinality</a></i> of a
set, i.e., the number of actual, <a href="LS1.html">true</a> member elements, only counts the
unique elements, not duplicates.<label id='fnr.11' for='fnr-in.11.2219476' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>11</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.11.2219476' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>11</sup>
In set theory we indicate the cardinality of a set \(A\) by
surrounding it with vertical pipes: \(|\,A\,|\) This is similar to the idea
of a number&rsquo;s <i>absolute value</i> which uses the same symbol.
</span>
</p>

<p>
⌜<br>
𝖟𝕭: The set \(A = \{1,1,1,2,2\}\) is identical to \(B = \{1,
2\}\), i.e., they have the same cardinality, or \(|\,A\,| = |\,B\,| =
2\).<label id='fnr.12' for='fnr-in.12.3691904' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>12</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.12.3691904' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>12</sup>
𝖟𝕭 is German for <i>zum Beispiel</i> or <i>for example</i>.
</span> <br>
⌟
</p>

<p>
This can be explained in a few ways. The simplest is to say the
members, the <i>elements</i> of a set <i>belong</i> to that set. So for example,
if I <i>belong</i> to a club, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to have me
belong-belong or belong twice to the club. But then set theory is a
very fundamental thing in higher math and is thus very precisely
defined based on axioms. For example, set theory has the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_extensionality">Axiom of
Extensionality</a></i> which says two sets are equal if they both have the
same members. In our example \(A\) and \(B\) do indeed have the same
members, namely, \(1\) and \(2\) &#x2014;and it doesn&rsquo;t matter that \(A\) repeats
these members.
</p>

<p>
⌜<br>
𝖟𝕭: Given the <b>set</b> \(A = \{\text{good, so-so, bad}\}\) and a <b>list</b> (as
a named Scheme list): <br>
<br>
<code>(define week3 '(good bad bad so-so so-so so-so good))</code> <br>
<br>
the set \(A\) signifies the possible moods a person might be in; while
<code>week3</code> is the name we&rsquo;ve defined for a list containing this daily
mood data we collected each day of week 3.<label id='fnr.13' for='fnr-in.13.4693493' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>13</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.13.4693493' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>13</sup>
Notice how we&rsquo;ve made a list containing our list in order to
define our list. More on how everything in Scheme is a list soon&#x2026;
</span> <br>
⌟
</p>

<p>
So the order of set \(A\) doesn&rsquo;t matter, but the order of the list
defined as <code>week3</code> is important because we don&rsquo;t want to mix up how we
felt on what day, Sunday, Monday, etc., good, bad, or so-so. Also, it
makes perfect sense for a list to have &ldquo;repeats&rdquo; since we&rsquo;re
evaluating many days in succession, and each day can be one of three
choices. But then notice one more thing about a set: When we built the
list <code>week3</code> we had to choose for each day (each successive position
in the list representing each day of the week) good <i>or</i> bad <i>or</i>
so-so. Remember Venn diagrams? For example, an <i>or-relationship</i> was a
<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(set_theory)">union</a></i> of the circles.<label id='fnr.14' for='fnr-in.14.7288065' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>14</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.14.7288065' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>14</sup>
A Venn diagram <br>
<img src="images/VennUnion.png" alt="VennUnion.png"> <br>
of two sets <i>or</i>-ed, <i>union</i>-ed together. The lens-shaped center
represents the &ldquo;overlap,&rdquo; i.e., what the two circles have in common.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Now, let&rsquo;s go beyond the colored Venn diagram circles and take a more
formal look at what a union is. Let&rsquo;s make a formal definition of a
union:
</p>

<p>
<font color = "#0d3db3"> The union of two sets \(A\) and \(B\)
(denoted by \(A \cup B\)) is the set of elements which are in \(A\), in \(B\),
<i>or</i> in both \(A\) and \(B\).  </font><label id='fnr.15' for='fnr-in.15.6487660' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>15</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.15.6487660' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>15</sup>
Could we have said, &#x2026;in \(A\) <b>and</b> in \(B\) <b>and</b> in both \(A\)
and \(B\)? Better not. More on why later.
</span>
</p>

<p>
This definition can be expanded to include more than just two
sets. For example, three common alphabets, the Greek, Latin, and
Cyrillic
</p>

\begin{align*}
G &= \{Α, Β, Γ, Δ, Ε, Ζ, Η, Θ, Ι, Κ, Λ, Μ, Ν, Ξ, Ο, Π, Ρ, Σ, Τ, Υ, Φ, Χ, Ψ, Ω\} \\
L &= \{A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\} \\
C &= \{A, Б, В, Г, Д, E, Ё, Ж, З, И, Й, K, Л, М, Н, О, П, Р, С, Т, У, Ф, Х, Ц, Ч, Ш, Ъ, \\
&  Ы, Ь, Э, Ю, Я\}
\end{align*}

<p>
Now, let&rsquo;s make a on big set \(A\) out of the individual sets \(G\), \(L\),
and \(C\)
</p>

\begin{align*}
A &= \{ Α, Β, Γ, Δ, Ε, Ζ, Η, Θ, Ι, Κ, Λ, Μ, Ν, Ξ, Ο, Π, Ρ, Σ, Τ, Υ, \\
& Φ, Χ, Ψ, Ω, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, \\
& S, T, U,  V, W, X, Y, Z, A, Б, В, Г, Д, E, Ё, Ж, З, И, Й, K, Л, М, Н, \\
& О, П, Р, С, Т, У, Ф, Х, Ц, Ч, Ш, Ъ, Ы, Ь, Э, Ю, Я\}
\end{align*}


<p>
Below we see a Venn diagram for \(A\), i.e., circles in which <i>three</i>
sets, alphabets, are contained. We can see how the circle edge lines
show the <i>intersection</i>, i.e., what any two alphabets share, and in
the very center what they all share
</p>

</figure>
</figure>

<p>
Of course for space purposes not <i>all</i> the letters could be fit into
the diagram above, but we can see how the Venn diagram with its
overlapping circles trick is beating duplicates. Yes, visually this is
happening, but is there a formal explanation?
</p>

<p>
First, let&rsquo;s look at a formal definition of union in so-called
<i>set-builder notation</i>
</p>

\begin{align}
A \cup B = \{x : x \in A \lor x \in B  \}
\end{align}

<p>
This expression says the <b>union</b> of \(A\) and \(B\) equals the set of
\(x\)&rsquo;s such that an \(x\) is an element coming from<label id='fnr.16' for='fnr-in.16.2765996' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>16</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.16.2765996' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>16</sup>
The symbol \(\in\) means &ldquo;in&rdquo; or &ldquo;member of.&rdquo;
</span> \(A\) <b><i>or</i></b> \(x\)
is an element of \(B\).<label id='fnr.17' for='fnr-in.17.1803119' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>17</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.17.1803119' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>17</sup>
\(\lor\) is the symbol for <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction">logical or</a></i>, aka <i>logical
disjunction</i>. Take a crack at the Wikipedia article.
</span> But wait, <b>or</b> doesn&rsquo;t quite sound right
in English if we mean to union-ize two or more things, does it? To
bring two or more sets together as one&#x2014;their unique and shared
element alike&#x2014;don&rsquo;t we mean to say, e.g., <font color =
"#0d3db3"> <i>the union of \(A\) and \(B\) takes all the elements from
both \(A\) <b>and</b> \(B\)</i>?</font> Yes, but set theory prefers to
look at, e.g., the Venn diagram of the alphabets (Figure 2 above) and
say, <font color = "#0d3db3">A letter <i>belongs</i> to the union
of alphabets if it is from the Greek <b>or</b> from the Latin <b>or</b> from the
Cyrillic alphabets.</font> Again, we have the idea of sets
and <i>belonging</i> to sets.
</p>

<p>
Now, look at that bulging middle triangle region of Figure 2
containing the letters all three alphabets have in common. This is the
<i>intersection</i> of alphabet sets \(G\), \(L\), and \(C\). In this case we
would say <font color = "#0d3db3">A letter <i>belongs</i> to the
center triangle (the intersection) if it belongs to \(G\) <i>and</i> it
belongs to \(L\) <i>and</i> it belongs to \(C\)</font>. That is to say
the letter has to be found in all three alphabets. This is more
precise, something upon which higher math always insists.
</p>

<p>
<label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle">
<span class="marginnote">
<img src="images/On_Off.jpg" alt="On_Off.jpg">
<br>
</span>
</p>

<p>
And now with one final piece of the puzzle we can put to rest this
whole duplicates with sets issue. Let&rsquo;s explore another logic concept
that we actually encounter every day. In the modern world we&rsquo;re
constantly turning things on and off, e.g., a light switch, a single
on-off button that &ldquo;toggle&rdquo; back and forth to on or off with each push
or flip. But occasionally we see, e.g., <i>two</i> buttons---<i>one</i> for on,
<i>one</i> for off. In the image to the right we have <i>two</i> buttons doing
on and off instead of one. In such a case pushing the green <i>on</i>
button just one initial time turns the device on <i>and any additional
pushing is disregarded</i>. This is the same for the red <i>off</i>
button. Push once for off&#x2014;and any further pushes mean nothing. This
is basically the formal logical version of &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have to repeat,
I heard you the first time.&rdquo; This logic phenomenon has an official
name: <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence">idempotence</a></i>, and crops up in many situations. For our
situation simply imagine making a Venn diagram of sets \(S_1 = \{5\}\)
and \(S_2 = \{5\}\), i.e., two different sets containing the same single
element. Would it not just be one single circle containing the element
\(5\)? And if we added another set \(S_3 = \{5\}\), we would have
</p>

\begin{align*}
S_1 \cup S_2 \cup S_3 = \{5\}
\end{align*}

<p>
Now for a bit of abstraction. Consider a <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_operation">binary operator</a></i>, i.e.,
anything that takes two objects and does something with them to
produce something new. For example, \(1 + 1\) makes \(1\) or \(3 \cdot 5\) for
\(3\) times \(5\) makes \(15\). Let&rsquo;s then use the abstract symbol \(\oplus\) or
any binary operator. Now we can establish a formal definition of
idempotence <br>
</p>

<p>
<font color = "#0d3db3">
The <i>binary operation</i> \(\oplus\) is said to be <b>idempotent</b> if
</p>

\begin{align*}
x \oplus x = x \,\,\text{for all}\,\, x \in S
\end{align*}
