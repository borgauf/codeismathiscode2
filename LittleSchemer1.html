This Socratic dialog explores in its chatty conversation style a sort
of loose <i>mathematical formalism</i> <label id='fnr.2' for='fnr-in.2.6692844' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.2.6692844' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup>
Go <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formalism_(philosophy_of_mathematics)">here</a> to see the Wikipedia discussion about mathematic
formalism&#x2014;although it&rsquo;s a bit formal&#x2026;
</span> where you the reader will
experience a growing mental picture of theory and syntax as the
conversation continues and the pages turn. Instead of making direct
statements about programming language syntax rules, we get a stream of
questions and replies that will gradually form the desired world in
our own minds. We are if effect <i>backing into</i> Scheme programming and
its underlying philosophy&#x2014;and underlying is quite a bit of important
computer science.
</p>

<p>
Some things, however, are directly stated. Before the first chapter
entitled <i>1. Toys</i>, even before the title page, there are listed
(jokingly named?) <i>The Ten Commandments</i>, followed by <i>The Five
Rules</i>. Again, this is a nod to, a play on the mathematical formalism
of an <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_system">axiomatic system</a></i>. But what do we mean by an axiomatic system
and why are they important?
</p>

<p>
The multi-volume set <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#Axioms">Euclid&rsquo;s Elements</a> (EE) from ca. 300 BC Greece is
generally accepted as being the first example of mathematics built on
axioms and pursued through proofs based on those axioms &#x2026; and EE has
been in the Western world&rsquo;s math curricula ever since. It was once a
staple of high school math, <i>though often dreaded</i>, as it was the
student&rsquo;s first exposure to the strange idea of <i>proving</i> math instead
of just doing math. Proving something in math requires a deep grasp of
a topic, which is completely different from the typical style of &ldquo;when
you see this, do this&rdquo; conditioning. Starting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#Axioms">Euclidean Geometry</a>,
the student is asked to see a geometric situation<label id='fnr.3' for='fnr-in.3.6293170' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.3.6293170' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup>
For example the (in)famous <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pons_asinorum">pons asinorum</a></i> in <i>Euclid&rsquo;s
Elements</i> <br>
<img src="images/Byrne_pons_asinorum.jpg" alt="Byrne_pons_asinorum.jpg"> <br>
where it is <i>proven</i> that indeed the angles opposite the equal sides
of an isosceles triangle are themselves equal.
</span> and understand
why something about it is <i>necessarily</i> (proven to be) true. The proof
of, e.g., the <i>pons asinorum</i> is a step-by-step establishing of
undeniable facts based on Euclid&rsquo;s axioms called <i>Postulates</i> and
<i>Notions</i>. Again, this was the beginning of modern mathematics where a
set of axioms could be called on to build <i>theorems</i>, i.e., additional
true assumptions. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_system">Axioms</a> can go by many names, e.g., basic truths,
givens, primitives. Here are Euclid&rsquo;s five postulates
</p>


<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>P1</dt><dd>A straight line may be drawn between any two points.</dd>
<dt>P2</dt><dd>Any terminated straight line may be extended indefinitely.</dd>
<dt>P3</dt><dd>A circle may be drawn with any given point as center and any
given radius.</dd>
<dt>P4</dt><dd>All right angles are equal.</dd>
<dt>P5</dt><dd>Through a given point \(P\) not on a line \(L\), there is one and
only one line in the plane of \(P\) and \(L\) which does not meet \(L\).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The last postulate is a more modern rewording of the original, meaning
<i>truly parallel lines may exist that never cross</i>. To these first
five, Euclid added another five basic truths, his <i>Common Notions</i>
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>N1</dt><dd>Things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to
each other.</dd>
<dt>N2</dt><dd>If equals are added to equals, the wholes (results) are equal.</dd>
<dt>N3</dt><dd>If equals are subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal.</dd>
<dt>N4</dt><dd>Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another.</dd>
<dt>N5</dt><dd>The whole is greater than the part.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
With these ten axiomatic statements begins much geometry, logic,
number and set theory. That is to say, great amounts of <i>implication</i>,
&ldquo;if this then that&rdquo; can be derived from these ten accepted
givens.<label id='fnr.4' for='fnr-in.4.6929844' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>4</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.4.6929844' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>4</sup>
In mathematical logic the idea of <i>implication</i> is very
fundamental. Something <i>implies</i> something else; because \(A\), that
means \(B\) as well. Implication goes by many names: <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_conditional">material
conditional</a></i>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_ponens">modus ponens</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_consequence">logical consequence</a>. We first see
implication in programming with the basic <i>if-then-else</i> conditional.
</span> For example, the last notion, N5, seems to say something
almost silly and trivial. But as <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/elements/bookI/cn.html">this treatment</a> explains, N5 is
introducing with its odd wording the basic concept of one thing being
<i>larger</i> than another, i.e., \(A>B\). Here&rsquo;s David E. Joyce&rsquo;s, professor
of mathematics at Clark University, explanation
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
To say one magnitude \(B\) is a part of another \(A\) could be taken as
saying that \(A\) is the sum of \(B\) and \(C\) for some third magnitude
\(C\), the remainder. Symbolically, \(A > B\) means that there is some \(C\)
such that \(A = B + C\).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Again, to the novice this may look like nit-picking, but real math
comes from having these basic foundational givens&#x2014;upon which new,
useful math is solidly, logically built. Higher math<label id='fnr.5' for='fnr-in.5.4653991' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>5</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.5.4653991' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>5</sup>
<i>Higher math</i> in the U.S. typically means those college math
courses pursued in the junior and senior year of a Bachelors math
degree, i.e., those courses <i>after</i> Calculus, Differential Equations,
and Linear Algebra.
</span> is the
realm of axiomatic math where proofs of <i>theorems</i> are the
staple. Higher math is where the student becomes a real mathematician
who looks under the hood and learns what makes things really tick.
</p>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s consider a more serious-looking set of axioms, again, taken from
course material by Professor Joyce, then a proof of a theorem based,
i.e., relying on these axioms<label id='fnr.6' for='fnr-in.6.974781' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>6</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.6.974781' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>6</sup>
These axioms are taken from Linear Algebra.
</span>
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Vector addition is <i>commutative</i>: \(\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v}\).</li>
<li>Vector addition is <i>associative</i>: \((\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) + \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} + (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w})\).</li>
<li>There is a vector, denoted \(\mathbf{0}\) such that \(\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{0} = \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0} + \mathbf{v}\).</li>
<li>For each \(\mathbf{v}\), there is another vector \(\mathbf{−v}\) such that \(\mathbf{v} + (\mathbf{−v}) =
   0\).</li>
<li>Scalar multiplication <i>distributes</i> over vector addition: \(c(\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) =
   c\mathbf{v} + c\mathbf{w}\).</li>
<li>Scalar multiplication <i>distributes</i> over real addition: \((c + d)\mathbf{v} = c\mathbf{v} + d\mathbf{v}\)</li>
<li>Multiplication and scalar multiplication <i>associate</i>: \(c(d\mathbf{v}) =
   (cd)\mathbf{v}\).</li>
<li>The number \(1\) acts as <i>identity</i> for scalar multiplication: \(1\mathbf{v}
   = \mathbf{v}\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
And now we&rsquo;ll prove a very basic theorem relying on these axiom truths
</p>

<p>
<font color = "#650d1c">
Theorem: \(0\mathbf{v} = 0\)
</font>
</p>

<p>
&#x2026;or zero times a vector \(\mathbf{v}\) is zero.
</p>

<p>
⌜<br>
<font color = "#650d1c">Proof: </font> Since \(0 + 0
= 0\), therefore we can say \((0 + 0)\mathbf{v} = 0\mathbf{v}\). By axiom <b>6</b>, that implies
\(0\mathbf{v} + 0\mathbf{v} = 0\mathbf{v}\). If we could subtract \(0\mathbf{v}\) from each side, we’d be
done, but subtraction isn’t yet defined. Still, we can add the
negation of \(0v\) to each side which should accomplish about the same
thing. Thus,
</p>

\begin{align*}
(0\mathbf{v} + 0\mathbf{v}) + (−0\mathbf{v}) = 0\mathbf{v} + (−0\mathbf{v}).
\end{align*}

<p>
Next, we can associate the parentheses differently by axiom <b>2</b> to get
</p>

\begin{align*}
0\mathbf{v} + (0\mathbf{v} + (−0\mathbf{v})) = 0\mathbf{v} + (−0\mathbf{v}).
\end{align*}

<p>
That equation simplifies by axiom <b>4</b> to \(0\mathbf{v} + 0 = 0\), and by
axiom <b>3</b>, that further simplifies to \(0\mathbf{v} = 0\) which is what
was to be proved. <b>Q.E.D.</b><label id='fnr.7' for='fnr-in.7.2560097' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>7</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.7.2560097' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>7</sup>
&#x2026; <i>quod erat demonstrandum</i>, meaning &ldquo;that which was to be
demonstrated&rdquo;.
</span> <br>
⌟
</p>

<p>
Got it? No worries (yet) if you didn&rsquo;t. The point is to understand
that this so-call higher math thing wants to be built exclusively on
axioms. But yes, this is a strange world for the beginner so used to
the usual &ldquo;get stuff calculated&rdquo; math. For example, in beginner
algebra we never needed to <i>show</i> with a proof that an entity times
zero is zero. So yes, here we have a thorough <i>proof</i> of something
that we normally would have taken for granted. But again, this is the
world of higher math where math becomes more of a philosophy than just
a set of tools.<label id='fnr.8' for='fnr-in.8.8340746' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>8</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.8.8340746' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>8</sup>
Go ahead and take a &ldquo;math holiday&rdquo; by touring <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/elements/bookI/cn.html">this page</a> by
Professor Joyce. He is speaking from a quasi-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory">set theory</a> standpoint,
i.e., the basis of modern high math. But remember, Euclid was talking
strictly about geometric shapes. Set theory had not been invented
yet&#x2026;

<h3 id="orgdf4739a">Axiomatic Scheme</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgdf4739a">
<p>
And now with no further ado we will list out TLS&rsquo;s version of
&ldquo;axiomatic givens&rdquo; starting with <i>The Ten Commandments</i>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>First Commandment</b>: When recurring on a list of atoms, <code>lat</code>, ask two
questions about it <code>(null? lat)</code> and <code>else</code>; when recurring on a
number, <code>n</code>, ask two questions about it: <code>(zero? n)</code> and <code>else</code>;
when recurring on a list of S-expressions, <code>l</code>, ask three question
about it: <code>(null?  l)</code>, <code>(atom? ( car l))</code>, and <code>else</code>.</li>
<li><b>Second Commandment</b>: Use <code>cons</code> to build lists.</li>
<li><b>Third Commandment</b>: When building a list, describe the first typical
element, and then <code>cons</code> it onto the natural recursion.</li>
<li><b>Fourth Commandment</b>: Always change at least one argument while
recurring. When recurring on a list of atoms, <code>lat</code>, use <code>(cdr
  lat)</code>. When recurring on a number, <code>n</code>, use <code>(sub1 n)</code>. And when
recurring on a list of S-expressions, <code>l</code>, use <code>(car l)</code> and <code>(cdr
  l)</code> if neither <code>(null? l)</code> nor <code>(atom? (car l))</code> are true. [One
argument] must be changed to be closer to termination. The changing
argument must be tested in the termination condition: When using
<code>cdr</code>, test termination with <code>null?</code> and when using <code>sub1</code>, test
termination with <code>zero?</code>.</li>
<li><b>Fifth Commandment</b>: When building a value with \(+\), always use \(0\)
for the value of the terminating line, for adding \(0\) does not
change the value of an addition.</li>
<li><b>Sixth Commandment</b>: Simplify only after the function is correct.</li>
<li><b>Seventh Commandment</b>: Recur on the <i>subparts</i> that are of the same
nature: on the sublists of a list; on the subexpressions of an
arithmetic expression.</li>
<li><b>Eighth Commandment</b>: Use help functions to abstract from
representations.</li>
<li><b>Ninth Commandment</b>: Abstract common patterns with a new function.</li>
<li><b>Tenth Commandment</b>: Build functions to collect more than one value at
a time.</li>
</ul>

<p>
But wait there&rsquo;s more. Next are the <i>The Five Rules</i>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>The Law of <code>car</code></b>: The primitive <code>car</code> is defined only for nonempty
lists.</li>
<li><b>The Law of <code>cdr</code></b>: The primitive <code>cdr</code> is defined only for nonempty
lists. The <code>cdr</code> of any nonempty list is always another list.</li>
<li><b>The Law of <code>cons</code></b>: The primitive <code>cons</code> takes two arguments. The
second argument to <code>cons</code> must be a list. The result is a list.</li>
<li><b>The Law of <code>null?</code></b>: The primitive <code>null?</code> is defined only for lists.</li>
<li><b>The Law of <code>eq?</code></b>: The primitive <code>eq?</code> takes two arguments. Each must
be a non-numeric atom.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Not many beginners can take these fifteen would-be axioms and know
exactly how to write a Scheme program.<label id='fnr.9' for='fnr-in.9.7878895' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>9</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.9.7878895' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>9</sup>
&#x2026;if we could, would each program we write technically be a
new <b>theorem</b>? More on that later. Specifically, we&rsquo;ll look into
Douglas Hofstadter&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MU_puzzle">MU puzzle</a> from his ground-breaking book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach">Gödel,
Escher, Bach</a> (1979).
</span> But then if you&rsquo;ve read
and understood a textbook such as <i><a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~gill/BWLectSite/Resources/LDGbookCOV.pdf">Lists, Decisions and Graphs&#x2026;</a></i> by
Edward Bender and S. Gill Williamson, you might catch on that these
&ldquo;fake&rdquo; axioms are attempting is to establish some sort of
omnibus<label id='fnr.10' for='fnr-in.10.2678217' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>10</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.10.2678217' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>10</sup>
&#x2026;containing or including many items.
</span> <i>list processing</i> machinery. In fact Scheme&rsquo;s
predecessor, <b>Lisp</b>, is an acronym for &ldquo;list processing,&rdquo; because this
is essentially what Lisp and Scheme do, i.e., they do computing tasks
with, on lists. Really?! So in Lisp and Scheme we have a complete
working programming language as just a bunch of lists stored in a
computer file that some sort of evaluator processes and gives results?
How does that work? Read on.
</p>

<p>
At this point we should really know, understand what a list is, seeing
as how a list can be seen as the most primitive, basic, introductory
data structure in programming. But then we all know in the everyday
sense what a list is, right? A grocery list is a good example
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>eggs</li>
<li>milk</li>
<li>flour</li>
<li>potatoes</li>
<li>butter</li>
</ul>

<p>
Not so fast. We have a problem&#x2014;at least with the math world. That&rsquo;s
because in higher math there are also <i>sets</i>. So what is the
difference between a list and a set? To the layman they might seem
interchangeable. <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory">Set theory</a></i> is the fundamental starting point of
higher math, as well as CS&rsquo;s Discrete Math.<label id='fnr.11' for='fnr-in.11.2861111' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>11</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.11.2861111' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>11</sup>
&#x2026;although it may be veiled or only partially explored.
</span> And so many books
on set theory and discrete math start out with the deceptively simple
and informal statement
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<font color = "#0d3db3"> <i> A <b>set</b> is collections of
things &#x2026; objects &#x2026; stuff. </font> </i>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
&#x2026;which is kind of what a list is too. But to CS and higher math they
are two different entities. What&rsquo;s the difference? First, our grocery
<i>list</i> is not technically a list because, again, in the CS/higher math
world, <i>the <b>elements</b> (members) of a list have a specific order</i>. But
then our grocery list above could be in any order, doesn&rsquo;t really
matter as long as you come home with the those groceries&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Plainly put, lists are defined as a collection of things in a specific
order. Think of a <i>string</i> of letters like you&rsquo;re reading right now. A
string of alphanumeric characters can be considered a list because
<i>the order of the individual alphanumeric characters (and spaces in
between) is everything</i>. We typically call strings of letters and
spaces <i>sentences</i> &#x2026; where all the sentences in English are made up
of differing combinations of the twenty-six letters (times two if we
have both upper- and lower-case), the ten numerals, punctuation, and
the space character. You can&rsquo;t be placing individual characters in any
order and still have sensible sentences. So is our &ldquo;grocery list&rdquo;
really a <i>set</i> of groceries?
</p>

<p>
Actually no. We should not call a grocery list a set either because
even though order doesn&rsquo;t matter, sets allow duplicates. Really? In
set theory there is the idea of the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality">cardinality</a></i> of a set, i.e., what
is the count of the <i>unique</i> elements of the set, <i>not</i> counting
duplicates.<label id='fnr.12' for='fnr-in.12.3849782' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>12</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.12.3849782' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>12</sup>
We indicate the cardinality of a set \(A\) by
surrounding it with vertical pipes: \(|\,A\,|\) This is similar to the idea
of a number&rsquo;s <i>absolute value</i> which uses the same symbol.
</span>
</p>

<p>
⌜<br>
𝖟𝕭: The set \(A = \{1,1,1,2,2\}\) is <i>identical</i> to set \(B = \{1, 2\}\)
because they have the same cardinality, or \(|\,A\,| = |\,B\,| =
2\).<label id='fnr.13' for='fnr-in.13.48032' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>13</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.13.48032' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>13</sup>
𝖟𝕭 is German for <i>zum Beispiel</i> or <i>for example</i>.
</span> <br>
⌟
</p>

<p>
This can be explained in a few ways. The simplest is to say the
members, the elements of a set <i>belong</i> to that set. So for example,
if I <i>belong</i> to a club, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to have me
<i>belong-belong</i> or belong twice to the club.<label id='fnr.14' for='fnr-in.14.1141179' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>14</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.14.1141179' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>14</sup>
&#x2026;paying double membership fees?
</span> In the example
above, \(1\) <i>belongs</i> to \(A\), so it doesn&rsquo;t need to belong again.
</p>

<p>
Splitting hairs? Yes, well, set theory is a very fundamental thing in
higher math and is, thus, very precisely defined based on axioms. For
example, set theory has the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_extensionality">Axiom of Extensionality</a></i> which simply and
directly states <font color = "#0d3db3"> two sets are equal
if they both have the same members</font>. In our example \(A\)
and \(B\) do indeed have the same members, namely, \(1\) and \(2\) &#x2014;and it
doesn&rsquo;t matter, it doesn&rsquo;t count that \(A\) repeats these members. Let&rsquo;s
look at another example
</p>

<p>
⌜<br>
𝖟𝕭: Given the <b>set</b> \(A = \{\text{good, so-so, bad}\}\) and a <b>list</b> (as
a named Scheme list): <br>
<br>
<code>(define week3 '(good bad bad so-so so-so so-so good))</code> <br>
<br>
the set \(A\) signifies the possible moods a person might be in; while
<code>week3</code> is the name we&rsquo;ve defined for a list containing this daily
mood data we&rsquo;re collecting each day of week 3.<label id='fnr.15' for='fnr-in.15.2560688' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>15</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.15.2560688' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>15</sup>
With our first introduction to Scheme syntax we&rsquo;ve made a list
containing our list in order to define our list. Notice the nested
parentheses. More on how everything in Scheme is a list soon&#x2026;
</span> <br>
⌟
</p>

<p>
So the order of set \(A\) doesn&rsquo;t matter (and we&rsquo;d ignore, say, a second
\(good\)), but the order of the list defined as <code>week3</code> is important
because we don&rsquo;t want to mix up how we felt on what day, Sunday,
Monday, etc., good, bad, or so-so. Also, it makes perfect sense for a
list to have &ldquo;repeats&rdquo; since we&rsquo;re evaluating many days in succession,
and each day can be one of the three choices. But then notice one more
thing about a set: When we built the list <code>week3</code> we had to choose for
each day (each successive position in the list representing each day
of the week) good <i>or</i> bad <i>or</i> so-so. Remember Venn diagrams from
pre-school/Kindergarten? For example, this sort of <i>or</i> situation
can be shown with a <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(set_theory)">union</a></i> of circles.<label id='fnr.16' for='fnr-in.16.6118732' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>16</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.16.6118732' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>16</sup>
A Venn diagram of two sets <i>or</i>-ed, <i>union</i>-ed together. <br>
<img src="images/VennUnion.png" alt="VennUnion.png"> <br>
The lens-shaped center area represents the &ldquo;overlap,&rdquo; i.e., what the
two sets represented as circles have in common.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Now, let&rsquo;s go beyond the colored Venn diagram circles and take a more
formal look at what a union is. Let&rsquo;s make a formal definition of a
union:<label id='fnr.17' for='fnr-in.17.2511831' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>17</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.17.2511831' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>17</sup>
\(\cup\) is the symbol for union.
</span>
</p>

<p>
<font color = "#0d3db3"> The union of two sets \(A\) and \(B\)
(denoted by \(A \cup B\)) is the set of elements which are in \(A\), in \(B\),
<b>or</b> in both \(A\) and \(B\).  </font><label id='fnr.18' for='fnr-in.18.4845699' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>18</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.18.4845699' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>18</sup>
Could we have said, &#x2026;in \(A\) <b>and</b> in \(B\) <b>and</b> in both \(A\)
and \(B\)? Better not. More on why later.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Now, for our set \(A = \{\text{good, so-so, bad}\}\), we are using each
element just once per the day slot of <code>week3</code>. We can imagine \(A\) as
made up of the individual sets
</p>

\begin{align*}
A_G &= \{\text{good}\} \\
A_{S} &= \{\text{so-so}\} \\
A_B &= \{\text{bad}\}
\end{align*}

<p>
Now, a union \(\{A_G \cup A_{S} \cup A_B \}\) will get us back to our original \(A
= \{\text{good, so-so, bad}\}\). Why are we looking at our set of mood
choices like this? Because our eventual software code will need some
sort of decision based on <b>or</b>, i.e., we need just <i>one</i> of the three
possibilities.
</p>

<p>
When we look at \(A_G\), \(A_{S}\), and \(A_B\) together we may call them
<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_sets">disjoint sets</a></i> since they have no elements in common when we
union-ize them. And so if we made a Venn diagram, there would
be no overlap between any of them. Lots more about data
representations of disjoint sets in the future.
</p>

<p>
For another example of three set union-izing let&rsquo;s take three common
alphabets as sets&#x2014;the Greek, Latin, and Cyrillic
</p>

\begin{align*}
G &= \{Α, Β, Γ, Δ, Ε, Ζ, Η, Θ, Ι, Κ, Λ, Μ, Ν, Ξ, Ο, Π, Ρ, Σ, Τ, Υ, Φ, Χ, Ψ, Ω\} \\
L &= \{A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\} \\
C &= \{A, Б, В, Г, Д, E, Ё, Ж, З, И, Й, K, Л, М, Н, О, П, Р, С, Т, У, Ф, Х, Ц, Ч, Ш, Ъ, \\
&  Ы, Ь, Э, Ю, Я\}
\end{align*}

<p>
Now, let&rsquo;s make a on big union-ed together set \(A\) out of the
individual sets \(G\), \(L\), and \(C\)
</p>

\begin{align*}
A &= \{ Α, Β, Γ, Δ, Ε, Ζ, Η, Θ, Ι, Κ, Λ, Μ, Ν, Ξ, Ο, Π, Ρ, Σ, Τ, Υ, \\
& Φ, Χ, Ψ, Ω, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, \\
& S, T, U,  V, W, X, Y, Z, A, Б, В, Г, Д, E, Ё, Ж, З, И, Й, K, Л, М, Н, \\
& О, П, Р, С, Т, У, Ф, Х, Ц, Ч, Ш, Ъ, Ы, Ь, Э, Ю, Я\}
\end{align*}

<p>
Below we see a Venn diagram for \(A\), i.e., circles in which the
<i>three</i> sets of alphabetic characters are contained. We can also see
how the intersecting circle edge lines also show the what <i>any two</i>
alphabets share, and then in the very center what they <i>all</i> share
</p>

</figure>

<p>
Of course for visual purposes not <i>all</i> the letters could be crowded
into the diagram above, but we can see how the Venn diagram with its
overlapping circles trick is beating duplicates. Visually we can see
this happening, but is there a formal explanation? Short answer: yes.
</p>

<p>
Now let&rsquo;s look at a formal definition of union in so-called
<i>set-builder notation</i><label id='fnr.19' for='fnr-in.19.1112021' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>19</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.19.1112021' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>19</sup>
(1) can be expanded for the union of more sets than just
two.
</span>
</p>

\begin{align}
A \cup B = \{x : x \in A \lor x \in B  \}
\end{align}

<p>
This expression says the <b>union</b> of \(A\) and \(B\) equals the set of
elements denoted by \(x\) such that an \(x\) can be an element from<label id='fnr.20' for='fnr-in.20.9835704' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>20</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.20.9835704' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>20</sup>
The symbol \(\in\) means &ldquo;in&rdquo; or &ldquo;member of.&rdquo;
</span>
\(A\) <b>or</b> an element from \(B\).<label id='fnr.21' for='fnr-in.21.913095' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>21</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.21.913095' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>21</sup>
\(\lor\) is the symbol for <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction">logical or</a></i>, aka <i>logical
disjunction</i>. Take a crack at the Wikipedia article.
</span> But wait, <b>or</b> doesn&rsquo;t quite
sound right in English if we mean to union-ize two or more things,
does it?  To bring two or more sets together as one&#x2014;their unique and
shared element alike&#x2014;don&rsquo;t we mean to say, e.g., <font color
= "#0d3db3"> <i>the union of \(A\) and \(B\) takes all the elements from
both \(A\) <b>and</b> \(B\)</i>?</font> Yes, but set theory prefers to
look at, e.g., the Venn diagram of the alphabets (Figure 2 above) and
say, <font color = "#0d3db3">A letter <i>belongs</i> to the union
of alphabets if it is from the Greek <b>or</b> from the Latin <b>or</b> from the
Cyrillic alphabets.</font> Again, we have the idea of sets
and <i>belonging</i> to sets.
</p>

<p>
Now, look at that bulging middle triangle region of Figure 2
containing the letters all three alphabets have in common. This is the
<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(set_theory)">intersection</a></i> of alphabet sets \(G\), \(L\), and \(C\). In this case we
would say: <font color = "#0d3db3">A letter <i>belongs</i> to the
center triangle (the intersection) if it belongs to \(G\) <b>and</b> it
belongs to \(L\) <b>and</b> it belongs to \(C\)</font>. In other
words, the letter has to belong to all three alphabets. This is more
precise, something upon which higher math always insists.

<p>
And with one final piece of the puzzle we can put to rest this whole
duplicates within sets issue. Let&rsquo;s explore another logic concept that
we actually encounter every day. In the modern world we&rsquo;re constantly
turning things on and off, e.g., a light switch with its on-off
toggle. But occasionally we see <i>two</i> buttons---<i>one</i> for on, <i>one</i>
for off. In the image to the right we have <i>two</i> buttons doing on and
off instead of one. In such a case pushing the green <i>on</i> button just
one initial time turns the device on <i>and any additional pushing is
disregarded</i>. This is the same for the red <i>off</i> button. Push once for
off&#x2014;and any further pushes mean nothing. Basically, &ldquo;I heard you the
first time, you don&rsquo;t have to repeat yourself.&rdquo; This phenomenon has an
official name: <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence">idempotence</a></i>, and it crops up in many real-life
places. For our set theory discussion imagine making a Venn diagram of
the union of sets \(S_1 = \{5\}\) and \(S_2 = \{5\}\), i.e., two different
sets containing the same single element. Wouldn&rsquo;t this union be just
one single circle containing the element \(5\)? Indeed it would. And if
we added another set \(S_3 = \{5\}\) to the union, we would still have
</p>

\begin{align*}
S_1 \cup S_2 \cup S_3 = \{5\}
\end{align*}

<p>
i.e., just one circle representing \(5\). In fact, we could union
together an infinite amount of <i>singleton</i><label id='fnr.22' for='fnr-in.22.1413467' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>22</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.22.1413467' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>22</sup>
A <b>singleton</b> (also known as a <b>unit set</b> or <b>one-point set</b>)
is a set with exactly one element.
</span> sets of the form \(S_n =
\{5\}\) and they would produce the singleton set \(\{5\}\). Now for a bit
of abstraction. Consider a <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_operation">binary operator</a></i>, i.e., anything that
takes two objects and does an operation on them to produce something
new. For example, addition is a binary operation, \(1 + 1\) is \(2\), as
is multiplication, \(3 \cdot 5\) is \(15\). Let&rsquo;s then use the abstract symbol
\(\oplus\) to indicate any sort of binary operator. Now we can establish a
formal definition of idempotence <br>
</p>

<p>
<font color = "#0d3db3">
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A <i>binary operation</i> \(\oplus\) is said to be <b>idempotent</b> on a set \(S\) if
\(x \oplus x = x \,\,\text{for all}\,\, x \in S\)</li>
<li>An element \(x\) of a set \(S\) is said to be <b>idempotent</b> under a
binary operator \(\oplus\) if \(x \oplus x = x\)</li>
</ul>
<p>
</font>
</p>

<p>
If multiplication is the binary operator on the set of all counting
numbers \(\mathbb{N}\) then what numbers of \(\mathbb{N}\)<label id='fnr.23' for='fnr-in.23.9728810' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>23</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.23.9728810' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>23</sup>
\(\mathbb{N}\) is the symbol for the <i>natural</i> numbers, i.e., the
positive integers \(1\), \(2\), \(3\ldots\) we use to count things.
</span> can we
call idempotent according to the definition? Well, only \(0\) and \(1\)
are idempotent:
</p>

\begin{align*}
0 \cdot 0 &= 0 \\
1 \cdot 1 &= 1
\end{align*}

<p>
All other numbers (\(x \gt 1\)) give increasingly larger squares of
themselves, hence, \(0\) and \(1\) are idempotent, but the binary
operation of multiplication is not.<label id='fnr.24' for='fnr-in.24.439212' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>24</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.24.439212' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>24</sup>
In her 2023 layman&rsquo;s book <i>The Joy of Abstraction</i>
mathematician Eugenia Cheng notes how the operation of mixing paint
colors is basically idempotent. Why? If we add one paint to one other
paint we always get just one new paint color. That is, there is never
an additive or multiplicative increasing or intensifying, just a new
color.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Now, let&rsquo;s consider something that came up in a <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/">StackExchange
Mathematics</a> discussion <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/155475/1-1-1-origin-of-this-convention">here</a>, which is tackling our issue of duplicates
in a set by asking, why is \(\{1,1\} = \{1\}\)? Below we have a slight
re-wording of the preferred, green-checked answer
</p>

<p>
<font color = "#0d3db3">
An unordered tuple \(\{a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4\dots\}\) is defined as <br>
</p>
\begin{align*}
\{x:x=a_1 \lor x=a_2 \lor x=a_3 \lor x=a_4 \lor\dots\}.
\end{align*}
<p>
By this convention,
</p>
\begin{align}
\{1,1\} = \{x:x=1 \lor x=1 \}
\end{align}
<p>
So by the <i>idempotency</i> of \(\lor\) we have (2) the same as \(\{ x : x = 1
\}\), hence,
</p>
\begin{align*}
\{1,1\} = \{1\}
\end{align*}
<p>
</font>
</p>

<p>
Notice we are relying on the <i>logical-or</i> binary operator being
idempotent for all \(x\) in the set. Generally, an <b>unordered n-tuple</b>
is a set of the form \(\{a_1,a_2,\ldots, a_n\dots\}\), although a <i>tuple</i> is
usually meant to be <i>ordered</i>.<label id='fnr.25' for='fnr-in.25.9738907' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>25</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.25.9738907' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>25</sup>
&#x2026;such as, e.g., a pair of <i>Cartesian coordinates</i> \((a,b)\)
where \(a\) is some real number on the <i>x-axis</i> and \(b\) is a real number
on the <i>y-axis</i>. Obviously, with a Cartesian coordinate system \((a,b)
\neq (b,a)\), since they&rsquo;d be entirely different points on the plane. The
only exception would be if \(a = b\).
</span> Again, idempotency of two
identical sets is obvious when seen as Venn diagrams, but now we&rsquo;ve
seen in exact language how they are idempotent.
</p>

<p>
By the way, <i>union</i> and <i>logical or</i> are complimentary ideas. Consider
this expression
</p>

\begin{align}
a \in X \cup Y \iff a \in X \lor a \in Y
\end{align}

<p>
What does that double-arrow in the middle mean? <i>If and only
if</i>. We&rsquo;ll go into \(\iff\) in more exact detail later, but for now it
means <font color = "#0d3db3">the truth of one side of the
\(\iff\) requires the other side to be true also.</font> So if
\(a\) is an element of the union of \(X\) and \(Y\) then \(a\) must be an
element of \(X\) <b>or</b> it is an element of \(Y\) <b>or</b> it is an element of
<i>both</i> \(X\) and \(Y\) &#x2014;and the other way around as well.

Next, lists. This lesson began our introduction to <i>lists</i>. We&rsquo;ll
learn more about how they are a very simple but important data
structure in computer <i>data management</i> &#x2026; but then we&rsquo;re using the
term <i>data management</i> differently then the greater lay world does. So
a quick word about the whole concept of <i>data</i> and <i>data structures</i>
before we really dive in ahead. Today the term <i>data</i> is mainly
understood to be gobs and gobs of stuff held in databases or other
storage schemes. That&rsquo;s not what we mean by data. For us &ldquo;data&rdquo; can
simply be a number returned from an algorithm. That is to say, data is
what the programming logic, the &ldquo;code&rdquo; is producing. Yes, of course,
this production of data can pool and amass into great piles in vast
electronic storage bins, but, for instance, this is data
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme" id="org568dfbd">'<span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">(</span>good bad bad so-so so-so so-so good<span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
i.e., a simple list surrounded in parentheses and prefaced by a
quotation mark (&ldquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;) at the beginning as is the custom in Scheme (and
Lisp). That quote at the opening parenthesis indicates this is not
code, rather, data. What we saw above
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme" id="org20f59bd"><span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">(</span><span class="org-keyword">define</span> <span class="org-function-name">week3</span> '<span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-2">(</span>good bad bad so-so so-so so-so good<span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-2">)</span><span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
is a mixture of both code and data. In the next lesson we&rsquo;ll get into
the weeds on just how this mixture of code and data can work together.
