It&rsquo;s a Monday morning in late July and the von der Surwitz
siblings&#x2014;the twins Ute and Uwe and big sister Ursula&#x2014;meet in a
reserved study room at the main university library to go over what
their <i>Introduction to Computer Science</i> teacher, Professor Chandra,
had discussed with them at the Novalis Tech Open House the previous
Saturday.
</p>

<p>
Having checked Professor Chandra&rsquo;s course syllabus on her website,
they already had made online purchases of the main text for the
course, <a href="https://www.collegepublications.co.uk/computing/?00004">The Haskell Road to Logic, Maths and Programming</a> by <a href="https://www.illc.uva.nl/NewsandEvents/News/Obituaries/Kees-Doets/">Kees
Doets</a><label id='fnr.1' for='fnr-in.1.7036216' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.1.7036216' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup>
† November 5th, 2024.
</span> and <a href="https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/d.j.n.vaneijck2/">Jan van Eijck</a>. During the open house at the convention
wing of the student center last Saturday, they had sat down together
at a table with the professor as she paged through the text and talked
extemporaneously about what parts she would like to handle and
how. She also demonstrated some code on her laptop. Before they
parted, she invited them to email her with any and all questions.
</p>

<p>
The professor encouraged them to dive into to the logic and sets
prerequires, along with the first few chapters of <i>The Haskell Road&#x2026;</i>,
as well as to get through as much <i><a href="https://learnyouahaskell.github.io/chapters.html">Learn You a Haskell for Great Good</a></i> as
possible.
</p>

<p>
Ursula von der Surwitz has plugged in her laptop to the room&rsquo;s big 4K
monitor and is scrolling through some of her personal notes.
</p>

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> So like
Professor Chandra said on Saturday, we&rsquo;re going to rely heavily on
logic and set theory. <br>
[murmurs of agreement and then silence] <br>
[continuing] It seems a bit ominous. <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> Out with the old
math, in with the new. <br>
[nods and agreement] <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢::</span> But like she was
saying, comp-sci math is sort of a grab-bag of higher math topics. She
said it&rsquo;s bits and pieces of what you&rsquo;d be learning as a math major
after all the calculus and differential equations and linear
algebra. <br>
[murmurs of agreement] <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> Like she was
showing us, you need to understand the underlying set theory to
properly define relations and functions. <br>
[more agreement murmurs] <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> Well, like
Vati<label id='fnr.2' for='fnr-in.2.3344225' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.2.3344225' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup>
German for <i>dad</i>, <i>papa</i>.
</span> said, his math degree really smoothed the way for his
chemical engineering studies. <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> Get as much math
as you can as early as you can. <br>
[murmurs of agreement] <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> Well, I&rsquo;m
psyched. <br>
[She looks around and receives nods] <br>
[continuing] I&rsquo;m psyched because &#x2014; as the professor said &#x2014; this
course is totally experimental and open-ended. She&rsquo;s basically going
to give us what she&rsquo;d be giving her college freshman and sophomores in
the CS department. And she&rsquo;s on sabbatical, so we get her total,
undivided attention.<br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> Amazing. It&rsquo;s only
us, her daughter &#x2014; and maybe three others who weren&rsquo;t there and
might not take it after all. Wow.<br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> Bottom line: We&rsquo;ve
got a once-in-a-lifetime chance to really learn a ton about
comp-sci. Yeah, this is totally amazing. <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> Now all we have to
do is hang on for dear life! <br>
[laughter] <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> [paging through
<i>Haskell Road&#x2026;</i> ] Did anyone look at the first chapter? <br>
[affirmative nods] <br>
[continuing] Wasn&rsquo;t too bad &#x2014; once I caught on to what he was
saying. But definitely, <i>Learn You a Haskell&#x2026;</i> helped. And the other
pre-reqs as well. <br>
[murmurs of agreement] <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> [pointing to a
page in <i>Haskell Road</i> first chapter] Right, creating a <i>test</i> for
prime numbers with Haskell code. <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> I was looking
around on the internet and I kept running into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic">Fundamental Theorem
of Arithmetic</a>. Know what I&rsquo;m talking about? <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> Right, it&rsquo;s where
all the <i>counting</i> natural numbers&#x2014;one, two, three, four&#x2014;off to
infinity&#x2014;are either prime themselves or just multiples of primes. <br>
[group pause to consider] <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> So all integers
are either a prime number themselves or <i>composed</i> of a multiple of
primes. Yeah, they call non-prime numbers <i>composite</i> numbers. <br>
[pause to think] <br>
[writing on the whiteboard] It makes sense. So looking at \(12\). You
can say it&rsquo;s \(3 \cdot 4\). But that contains composite number \(4\), which
you can break down into \(2 \cdot 2\). So \(12 = 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 2\), which is, of
course, all primes. And as I remember, the order of the primes doesn&rsquo;t
matter. <br>
[murmurs of agreement] <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> Lots of lore
around primes. <br>
[more murmurs of agreement] <span
class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> So do you remember back in
school in Kiel we first learned to add and subtract fractions with
unlike denominators? <br>
[murmurs of acknowledgement] <br>
[continuing] First we just learned to cross-multiply to get the
numerators, then multiply the denominators together to get the new
denominator, then add or subtract the numerators, then reduce the
answer. <br>
[murmurs of acknowledgement] <br>
[continuing] But <i>then</i> we learned the prime factorization way. I can
hear the teacher actually saying that all whole numbers are either
primes or multiples of primes. <i>And</i> we were supposed to notice how
fractions always start out as a whole number over a whole number. <br>
[affirmative murmurs] <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> Yes, right,
that business of fractions being in their <i>rational</i> form&#x2014;rational
meaning in a <i>ratio</i>. But then fractions could also be in their
<i>decimal</i> form. Right. I remember all the odd things about what a
ratio, or in German <i>Verhältnis</i>, really meant. <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> When we had that
class we also talked about why the Greeks said, for example, \(7\)
<i>measures</i> \(35\;\). Yeah, so that means \(7\) <i>divides</i> \(35\) evenly, no
remainder. And then there was <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commensurability_(mathematics)">commensurable</a></i> and <i>incommensurable</i>,
which is about rational and irrational. <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> Oh yeah, I
remember! The teacher said that a rational number, a fraction, falls
somewhere on the number line that can be <i>measured</i> by some unit on
the number line. But I&rsquo;m a bit hazy on just what that really means
now. Oh well, skip it!<br>
[laughter] <br>
[continuing] No, no, I remember now! So say you have
\(\frac{3}{16}\). That&rsquo;s \(3\) <i>measures</i> of the <i>unit</i> \(16ths\) &#x2014;or the
number line divided into \(16ths\) &#x2014;then you go out three ticks on
this line divided into \(16ths\) to where \(\frac{3}{16}\) is on
the number line. So technically \(3\) and \(16\) are <i>commensurate</i>. <br>
[silence&rsquo; confused faces of female siblings]
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> [calling up
Wikipedia article] No, no, not quite, dear brother. [then finding
another article on commensurability, studying it, then going to the
board] No, here [drawing]:
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/two_line_segments1.png" alt="two_line_segments1.png"><br>
Take these two line segments. If there exists another smaller line
segment
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/single_line_segment.png" alt="single_line_segment.png"><br>
</p>

<p>
such that the small line can be used to evenly <i>measure</i> the two
larger line segments <br>
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/two_line_segments2.png" alt="two_line_segments2.png"><br>
then the two larger line segments are <i>commensurate</i>, exactly because
the smaller segment is their <i>common measure</i>. In other words, the two
larger segments are whole number multiples of the third, smaller
length. <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> But then doesn&rsquo;t
unit \(1\) always wind up being the common measure? <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> Because two line
segment lengths&#x2014;or just numbers, like \(\frac{3}{16}\) &#x2014;can be shown
to be commensurate, with common measure <i>unit</i> \(1\), then we can say
it&rsquo;s a rational number with a place on the number line. <br>
[confused looks]
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> So the
Wikipedia articles says this [writing on the board]
</p>

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> Let&rsquo;s bring it
back to Earth, shall we? [laughter] The bottom line is rational
numbers are numbers where a ratio of integers can represent a real
place on the number line. If this is true, then the numerator and
denominator are commensurate. But if you can&rsquo;t represent a number as a
ratio of two integers, then it is <i>irrational</i>. <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> But what about
decimal numbers? Like, say, \(1.5\)? <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> No problem. We
still can express this as a rational number [writing on the board]
</p>

\begin{align*}
\frac{1.5}{1}
\end{align*}

<p>
Now, we multiply top and bottom by \(2\) and get
</p>

\begin{align*}
\frac{3.0}{2} = \frac{3}{2}
\end{align*}

<p>
and there&rsquo;s the trick to turn any decimal into a rational of just
integers. 
</p>








<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> So <i>irrational</i>
numbers are <i>incommensurable</i> because you can&rsquo;t divide the number line
into any units&#x2014;no matter how fine&#x2014;that can then be measured out to
an exact spot. <br>
[murmurs of agreement from girl siblings] <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> I like the idea
our math teacher gave us about irrationals, that you can have a
<i>rational</i> number slightly less than and a <i>rational</i> number slightly
greater than your irrational number. But then no matter how close you
make the less-than and greater-than numbers to the irrational, you
never get to the irrational number. She said it&rsquo;s like looking down
into a bottomless abyss on the number line. <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> You know what
we&rsquo;re doing? We&rsquo;re relearning math as humans&#x2014;and not just as circus
animals learning tricks. <br>
[laughter] <br>
[continuing] No, really! So much of math before in school was just
repeating stuff without really knowing at any deep level what was
going on. <br>
[murmurs of agreement, albeit grimly] <br>
[silence, interrupted by Ursulua] <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> [brings up the
Wikipedia article on the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic in both
English and German, then reading from the English page] <br>
<font color = "#4715b3"> <i>Every positive integer \(n > 1\) can
be represented in exactly one way as a product of prime powers</i>.
</font> <br>
Right. So down further in the proof it uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_lemma">Euclid&rsquo;s lemma</a>, which says
<br>
<font color = "#4715b3"> <i>If a prime \(p\) divides the product
\(ab\), then \(p\) divides either \(a\) or \(b\) or both</i>.  </font>
<br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> Fun stuff, that
second one. So what does it mean? [pulling an ironic face] <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> [also ironically]
I&rsquo;ll have to think about it a bit&#x2026; <br>
[laughter] <br>
[continuing] No, it must work towards explaining exactly
<i>mathematically</i>. how all numbers must be multiples of just primes and
not other <i>composite</i> numbers. <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> Well, for your
information I did look into this. And for part of the
proof. [half-mumbling the German page&rsquo;s proof] it uses a contradiction
proof. Our favorite. <br>
[laughter] <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> Oh, right, good
old contradiction. That&rsquo;s where you take off at top speed at a brick
wall, smash into brick wall, <i>die</i> &#x2026; and then you know you should
have gone exactly the opposite direction. <br>
[laughter] <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> So yeah, once
you&rsquo;ve done all the factoring all numbers are products of primes. <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> Just accept it and
use it. Don&rsquo;t try to prove it. Time to think like a physicist. <br>
[laughter] <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> I guess
technically we can factor a prime. Any prime is just itself times
\(1\). <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> I looked into this
and somewhere they called that business of a number just times \(1\) a
<i>singleton</i> factoring. <br>
[girl siblings stare blankly at Uwe. Then laughter.] <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> [continuing]
But seriously, we have to get used to the exact terminology. For
example, non-prime numbers that are multiples of smaller numbers are
called <i>composite</i> numbers. <br>
[silence] <br>
[continuing] So, do we just trust that all numbers are multiples of
primes? Or do we go further down the rabbit hole? <br>
[siblings look at one another] <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> Remember how that
one book&#x2014;can&rsquo;t remember which&#x2014;began the whole discussion of primes
with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes">Sieve of Eratosthenes</a>?<label id='fnr.3' for='fnr-in.3.5913226' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.3.5913226' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup>
Animated Sieve of Eratosthenes <br>
<img src="images/Animation_Sieve_of_Eratosth.gif" alt="Animation_Sieve_of_Eratosth.gif"> <br>
</span> <br>
[murmurs of agreement] <br>
[continuing on the board] It shows how just by starting at the
beginning of the set of primes, \(2\), \(3\), \(5\), \(7\), et cetera, you can
go through the increasing positive integers, \(1\), \(2\), \(3\), \(4\), \(5\),
\(6\), and so on, <i>eliminating everything that&rsquo;s not a prime</i>, that is,
the <i>composite</i> numbers, by eliminating all <i>multiples</i> of the primes,
like all the multiples of \(2\), then the all multiples of \(3\), then all
multiples of \(5\) &#x2014; <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> Yes, and if you
keep doing that you wind up with only primes left. Which is sort of a
brute-force way of showing that any composite, non-prime number is the
product of primes. <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> So by
eliminating all multiples of primes&#x2014;because their composites
obviously&#x2014;we&rsquo;re showing, at least intuitively, that all numbers not
prime themselves are <i>multiples</i> of primes. <br>
[murmurs of agreement, albeit hesitant] <br>
[silence] <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> And that&rsquo;s good
enough for now? <br>
[laughter] <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> Not so fast. <br>
[laughter] <br>
We need to come back to Euclid&rsquo;s lemma: [reading] <br>
<i>If a prime \(p\) divides the product \(a \cdot b\), then \(p\) divides either
\(a\) or \(b\) or both</i>. And this is used to prove everything&rsquo;s a multiple
of primes. <br>
[twins&rsquo; blank faces] <br>
[continuing] Right, so, ramping up the abstraction, if a number \(n\) is
divisible by, say, \(a\), that means there has to be some other number
\(b\) where \(a \cdot b = n\).  And since \(a\) divides \(n\) and doesn&rsquo;t just
give \(1\), that means essentially \(a \leq b < n\). <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> But when I glanced
over this they were jumping to both \(a\) and \(b\) being themselves the
products of primes, weren&rsquo;t they? <br>
[going to the board] <br>
\(a = p_1,p_2 \ldots p_r\), \(b = q_1,q_2 \ldots q_k\) \(\implies\) \(n =
p_1,p_2 \ldots p_r \cdot q_1,q_2 \ldots q_k\) <br>
and yeah, it&rsquo;s all primes all the way down. <br>
[silence as the siblings study the board] <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> So the
take-away is, if a number is a multiple of two other numbers, then at
least one of these other numbers, \(a\) or \(b\), has to be either prime
itself or again a multiple of two number&#x2014;then again one of those&#x2014;
<br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> [writing on board]
Right, so if \(n = a \cdot b\) and \(n = 16\), then let&rsquo;s say \(a = 2\) and \(b =
8\). Then \(a\) is already prime, and \(b\) is not. So you would apply the
rule again to \(b\) and get \(b = c \cdot d\) where \(c = 2\) and \(d = 4\) &#x2014;and
so on. <br>
[silence and they study the board] <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> But really, some
sort of recursion, some sort of drilling down is going on here. How is
that provided for? I don&rsquo;t see any sort of drilling down until the
factors are all primes, do you? <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> No, but in
Cummings&rsquo; <i>Proofs</i> I think he&rsquo;s saying, yes, this is done with
<i>strong</i> induction. You simply assume as the starting hypothesis that
smaller things than \(n\) like \(a\) and \(b\) have already been proved as
built by prime factorization. So for example, if you start with \(2\),
which is the base case, then keep going up, you&rsquo;ve got your
&ldquo;drill-down&rdquo;. I mean, I guess. <br>
[silence] <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span>Well, okay, all
right then&#x2014;I guess&#x2026;<br>
[laughter] <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> So \(a\) and \(b\) may
also be composite, but we can attack them individually until we have
their factors finally down to a primes as well. That&rsquo;s whats really
happening with strong induction. But no, I don&rsquo;t really get yet. <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> <i>Haskell
Road&#x2026;</i> keeps the actual discussion about the Fundamental Theorem of
Arithmetic for a much later chapter. <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> In other words,
we&rsquo;re jumping the gun a little. We shouldn&rsquo;t worry about it. We&rsquo;re
just trying to create a prime test. <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> By the way, were
you blown away when Professor Chandra just put two fractions with huge
unlike denominators into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racket_(programming_language)">Racket</a> command line<label id='fnr.4' for='fnr-in.4.8263294' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>4</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.4.8263294' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>4</sup>
Professor Chandra has demonstrated at the Racket command line

\(17\:\) is the amount the numerator of the original \(1/15\) has to be

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> [continuing on the

\begin{align*}

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> [continuing] So we

\begin{align*}

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> Wait. I think
we&rsquo;re doing this wrong. We shouldn&rsquo;t need to factor out the \(5\;\),
right? So the common denominator should have been just the prime \(3\)
times the prime \(17\) because the prime \(5\) should have been left
out. Both \(15\) and \(85\) just have one \(5\) each as a factor. So if they
both have \(5\) let&rsquo;s just leave it out.<br>
[silence] <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> [continuing] So
those tables, Ute, maybe we can just subtract one table from the other

<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> [typing
calculations into the Racket command line] Not sure about that, dear
brother. My gut tells me &#x2014; and my memory too &#x2014; that no, it&rsquo;s not
that simple. So, just for sake of argument, if they have a common
prime factor then let&rsquo;s leave it out &#x2026; <i>if</i> they&rsquo;re the same
exponentially. So we had both denominators with the prime factor
\(5^{1}\:\). Good. We drop it. But then what if they share a prime factor
but different exponentiations of it?  What then? <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> Explain,
please. <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> [typing into

<p>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> [continuing] So
\(20\) is \(2^{2}\) times \(5\:\), and \(28\) is that same \(2^{2}\) times \(7\;\). So
yes, we&rsquo;ll get rid of the \(2^{2}\) &#x2014; they&rsquo;re the same prime factor
raised to the same exponent &#x2014; and we just multiply the \(5\) and the
\(7\) to get \(35\:\), which is the denominator \(35\;\). And the answer
Racket gives us, \(3/35\;\), is in simplest form, so we know it&rsquo;s
right. <i>But</i>, let me try an example where there&rsquo;s a prime to a power

<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> [continuing] So
I&rsquo;ve put together a situation where \(80\) is \(2^{4}\) times \(5\;\), and \(88\)
is \(2^{3}\) times \(11\;\). And here we see \(880\:\) is the smallest
denominator possible. And \(21/880\;\) is in simplest form, so there&rsquo;s
no factoring out to get it into simpler terms. And yes, \(2^{4}\) times \(5\)
times \(11\) went into making \(880\;\). <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> Yeah, I see. The
\(2^{4}\) did have to go into it. And it was the \(2\) with the higher

the \(2\) and then make up a denominator out of \(2 \cdot 5 \cdot 11\) which would

<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> Again, I just
barely understand all these components. I sort of understand <code>map</code>. I
sort of understand what you&rsquo;re doing with sections, as they&rsquo;re
called. I sort of understand what Brother just said. So I&rsquo;m going to
guess that you have the list of functions in the form of sections, and
you just told it to apply this list of functions to the list
<code>[1,2,3]</code>. <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔯𝔰𝔲𝔩𝔞:</span> Not
exactly. I&rsquo;m still trying to figure that one out. No, what I&rsquo;m doing
is using the Haskell index operator <code>!!</code> to say &ldquo;give me the third
element,&rdquo; which is the function <code>(3+)</code>. Even though it says <code>2</code>, the
index starts at <code>0</code>, so the third function in <code>myListOfAddFuncs</code> is
<code>(3+)</code> and <code>map</code> then applies it across <code>[1,2,3]</code> giving <code>[4,5,6]</code>
since it adds <code>3</code> to each element of the input list. See? <br>
[nods and murmurs of agreement] <br>

<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> Right. Wow. So
this is literally taking all combinations of the multiples of \(15\) and
\(85\;\), and there towards the end you can see the <code>(255,255)</code>, which
is the very first common multiples match, which makes it the <i>lowest</i>
match. But then your original code is filtering out all the
unnecessary combinations of the multiples. <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> So with the
original code, the <code>x &lt;- [1..200]</code> and the <code>y &lt;- [1..200]</code> simply
you&rsquo;re going through \(200\) of the arithmetic progression for both the
\(15\) and the \(85\;\), and you&rsquo;re creating all the different combination
pairs of these multiples of \(15\) and \(85\;\), the first time the
multiples are the same, you&rsquo;ve got a winner. This time it was when it
returned \((225,225)\;\). So you just take the first parameter, which is
\(15\) times all these different combinations of multiples of \(15\) and
\(85\;\), and with that qualifier <code>(*dnom1)x == (*dnom2)y</code> you&rsquo;re
keeping only the times you get a hit, that is, \(255\) equals \(255\;\)
&#x2014; and then you take the first one of that list. <br>
[silence while studying the code] <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔱𝔢:</span> [dramatically] And
now, dear siblings, we can honestly say that we can solve
unlike-denominator fractions. <br>
[laughter] <span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> I have
to say, when we have to pull math out of our heads and put on a
computer, it&rsquo;s, yeah, <i>involved</i>, to say the least. <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> But I can see the
day when we&rsquo;re good enough at coding to just immediately shake
something out of our sleave. <br>
<span class="fraktur">𝔘𝔴𝔢:</span> But it won&rsquo;t be
easy getting there. <br>
