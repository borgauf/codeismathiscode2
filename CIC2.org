* A first good look at sets

** Set theory as the starting line of mathematics

**[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory][Set theory]]** is the generally accepted starting point of higher
mathematics.[fn:1] Set theory is math's continuing attempt to
systematize itself and "get based." It may strike you as odd or ironic
that the entire world of mathematics has decided to base itself on
such a seemingly unassuming thing as sets. But as we gain more
knowledge of set theory, the logical entailment, the "one thing
entails the next" will only grow and the choice of set theory as a
basis will make more and more sense.[fn:2]

So many sources, especially treatments for the layperson, start out
with this deceptively simple and informal statement of what a set is,
or words to this effect

#+begin_quote
@@html:<font color = "#0d3db3"> <i>@@ A **set** is a collection of
things ... objects ... stuff. @@html:</font> </i>@@
#+end_quote

It's possible these authors have read the deceptively simple original
definition from set theory's founder, Georg Cantor, when, back in
1874, he defined a set with his **Axiom of Unrestricted
Comprehension** and simply paraphrased---badly...

#+begin_quote
@@html:<font color = "#0d3db3">@@ A set is a gathering together into a
whole of definite, distinct objects of our perception or of our
thought.  @@html:</font>@@
#+end_quote

...perhaps because Cantor, at first glance, seems so light and
airy. But let's unveil what Cantor is really saying[fn:3]

- establish some __membership__ criterion,
- gather things passing this __membership__,
- and call it a unique set of those things.
 
Early tip: Cantor is all about __membership__ and exactly how it works
in the world of math---although this doesn't necessary jump out at us
at this point. In set notation we can express a set as

\begin{align*}
\exists S\, \forall x\, (x \in S \iff P(x))
\end{align*}

Reading this out loud, /there is, there exists ($\exists$) a set $S$, and
for all ($\forall$) $x$'s a particular $x$ is an element, a __member__ of
set $S$ if and only if that particular $x$ satisfies the property
$P$/. It says that if we have a reasonably descriptive, defining
property or criterion, actual things passing this criterion can be
grouped together and called a set.

It would seem set theory creates The ability to regard any collection
of objects as a single entity, i.e., as a set. As it turned out,
Cantor was too permissive with his idea of constructing sets. His
definition allows us to create sets out of the absolute void---simply
state a qualifying property, no matter how crazy---and anything in the
conceivable universe passing the test can be in a set. Trouble started
when a famous logician Bertrand Russell, using this loose definition,
came up with a devastating paradox. We'll go into **[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox][Russell's
Paradox]]** later, but suffice it to say the math world was
shocked. Whole schools of logic came crashing down and had to go back
to the drawing board. We'll continue with what is now called **[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_set_theory][Naive
set theory]]**, albeit with minor, behind-the-scenes tweaks. But before
we go on, let's get a better handle on just what's meant when we say
/property/, /predicate/, and /statement/. These concepts are from
mathematical logic.

In the programming language **[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog][Prolog]]** we express "Kathy is a parent"
as ~parent(kathy)~. This is a /statement/ --- either true or
false. ~parent~ itself is a /property/, i.e., the idea, the property
of being a parent. In the form ~parent(X)~ with variable ~X~ it
becomes a /predicate/. Until we provide a value for ~X~ the predicate
~parent(X)~ is not yet a statement discernable as true or false. We
need to plug something in, e.g., ~parent(kathy)~. Tying this into our
discussion, the set of ~parent~'s can be expressed as[fn:4]

\begin{align*}
\exists S\, \forall X\, (X \in S \iff parent(X))
\end{align*}

In logic a predicate is described as a "verb phrase template
verbalizing" a property. In the previous example ~parent~ becomes the
verb phrase /is a parent/, and so we have ~parent(kathy)~ meaning
"Kathy is a parent."

Predicates are the namesake of /Predicate Calculus/ or **First-order
logic** (FOL), which we will dive into later when we tackle logic. In
effect, FOL is the "operating system" on which theories like set
theory run. FOL provides the "grammar" for reasoning with these key
grammatical components:[fn:5]

- **Terms (Nouns)** represent objects. These can be constants
  (~socrates~), variables (~x~), or functions.
- **Predicates (Verbs/Adjectives)** describe properties or
  relationships (e.g., $Man(x)$ or $Likes(x, y)$). These are the
  components that carry factual meaning.
- **Connectives (Logic glue)** are symbols like $\land$ (and), $\lor$ (or),
  $\neg$ (not), and $\implies$ (implies).
- **Quantifiers (Scope)**: $\forall$ (Universal - "for all") and $\exists$
  (Existential - "there exists").
- **Equality** is a special binary predicate built into FOL---which we
  discussed in a separate math holiday.
- **Punctuation**: Parentheses and commas to group logic statements.

Again, FOL is the tool bag---out of which set theory is
constructed. These basic FOL components---connectives, quantifiers,
variables, equality, and punctuation---are also known as /logical
symbols/. This is a fixed logical apparatus that belongs to FOL itself
and never changes from one theory to another.

A theory such as set theory has what is called an FOL /signature/,
which is math-talk for a set of symbols.[fn:6] In the case of set theory
/the signature consists of just one thing: membership $\in$/. This means
statements in set theory are built by combining the FOL symbols listed
above with the $\in$ symbol---all this towards establishing set
membership. This makes intuitive sense since at its core set theory is
about what belongs in a set. From now on be aware that when we have an
expression like our ~parent~ example

\begin{align*}
\exists S\, \forall X\, (X \in S \iff parent(X))
\end{align*}

/this is actually an FOL expression/; it is made up of the
building blocks of FOL listed above. Like we saw with Apostol,
we are formalizing by creating a toolbox.





We'll approach sets with a bit more exactness[fn:7]

** Set basics

⇲ @@html:<font color = "#0d3db3">@@ A /set/ is a collection of objects,
considered as a single object. The objects making up the set are
called /elements/ or /members/ of the set. If $x$ is an element of a set $A$,
we write $x \in A$; if not, we write $x \notin A$.[fn:8] The set which has no
elements is called the empty set and denoted $\emptyset$.  @@html:</font>@@

This definition is /very/ general. In the wild, sets can be found with
elements

- unordered, i.e., no particular order can be assumed
- duplicated

...for example,[fn:9]

\begin{align}
S_{a,b} = \{a,a,b \} = \{a,b\} = \{b,a\} \\
\end{align}

Analyzing the three versions of \(S_{a,b}\) we can see both of our bullet
items at play, i.e., /duplicates and order don't matter/, they're all
the same set \(S_{a,b}\).[fn:10]

But aren't we missing something? We don't seem to have a proper way to
explain this structural behavior of sets. As it happens, duplicates
and order are handled by set theory's version of identity and the
Leibniz Law, the **Axiom of Extensionality**, which states

⇲@@html:<font color = "#0d3db3">@@ If $A$ and $B$ are sets, then $A =
B$ if and only if every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$, and
vice versa.  @@html:</font>@@

First, what does the word /extensionality/ mean in this context? One
quote about sets says

#+begin_quote
Sets are purely **extensional** entities, defined only by their unique
members.
#+end_quote

Actually, this description tells us exactly what the word
/extensional/ means in this context; however, our deeply ingrained
sense of English semantics won't allow us to accept it. In everyday
English, /extension/ usually refers to physical space or time, e.g.,
extending a deadline or a ladder. In logic and linguistics,
/extension/ refers to the breadth or scope of a concept, specifically,
/the collection of all things to which a concept applies/. More
precisely for us:

⥤ The /extension/ of a concept or term is the set of actual objects
the term identifies in the world.

⌜\\
𝖟𝕭: The __extension__ of the word /planet/ can be Mercury, Venus,
Earth,... \\
⌟

⥤ The __intension__ (with an 's') of a term is its /internal/ meaning,
concept, or definition used to determine if something belongs to it.

⌜\\
𝖟𝕭: The intension of the word /planet/ can be, /a celestial body
moving in an elliptical orbit around a star/. \\
⌟

In general, an entity is "extensional" if two of such entities are
considered identical whenever they have the same /external/ components
or results, regardless of how they were constructed or described. /And
so we are calling sets extensional over intensional in order to
consider only their elements/. Another example

⌜\\
𝖟𝕭: $\{1,2,3\}$ is the same as $\{ x \in \mathbb{N} \mid x < 4 \}$[fn:11]
extensionally. The description changed, but the /extension/, i.e., the
actual elements remain exactly the same. \\
⌟

In the same vein

⌜\\
𝖟𝕭: In logic, the statement $2+2=4$ and "The Earth is round" both have
the /extension/ /True/, even though their meanings are not the same.  \\
⌟

and

⌜\\
𝖟𝕭: The /evening star/ and the /morning star/ can both refer to the
planet Venus. The extensionality of both is therefore Venus. \\
⌟

Now let's circle back and finally tie in why Cantor used the word
/comprehension/ in his initial definition.

@@html:<font color = "#0d3db3">@@ In a linguistic and logical sense,
the /comprehension/ of something refers to the collection of
properties that define it.
@@html:</font>@@

For Cantor that meant

- /Intension/: The property or rule (e.g., "being an even number").
- /Extension/: The actual objects that fit that rule (e.g., $\{2,4,6,\ldots\}$

Cantor’s definition suggested that any property (intension) could
define a set (extension). Therefore, the principle states that for any
property $P$, there exists a set containing all objects that
"comprehend", i.e., satisfy that property.


The /Axiom of Extensionality/ gives sets the power to define equality
or identity very precisely. It nails down why $S$ can be all three
variations and still equal. In other words, this is how it allows
duplicates! Again, if two sets, \(A\) and \(B\), share all the same
elements \(z\), they are the same set, i.e., /nothing but their
extensionality matters/ Here are two versions presented in higher-math
notation

\begin{align}
\forall z (z \in A \iff z \in B) \implies A = B \\
A = B \iff \forall z (z \in A \iff z \in B) 
\end{align}

~(2)~ in words: /For all $z$: $z$ is in $A$ if and only if $z$ is in
$B$, which implies $A$ equals $B$/. This ensures that sets are
uniquely determined by their elements and nothing else—no hidden
structure or distinctions beyond membership.

Leibniz Law


Then our grocery list is a /set/ of groceries? Now we come to our
second fork in the road: No, we should not call a grocery list a /set
of groceries/ either, because even though with sets order doesn't
matter, /sets allow duplicates/, whereas with a grocery list a
duplicated item would just seem like a mistake.[fn:12] In set theory
there is the /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality][cardinality]]/ of a set, i.e., what is the count of the
/unique/ elements of the set, /not/ counting duplicates. We indicate
the cardinality of a set $A$ by surrounding it with vertical pipes:
$|\,A\,|$ This is similar to the idea of a number's /absolute value/
which uses the same vertical bar symbols.

⌜\\
𝖟𝕭: The set $A = \{1,1,1,2,2\}$ is /identical/ to set $B = \{1, 2\}$
because they have the same /cardinality/, or $|\,A\,| = |\,B\,| =
2$. \\
⌟\\

This can be explained in a few ways. The simplest is to say the
members, the elements of a set /belong/ to that set. So for example,
if I /belong/ to a club, it doesn't make sense to have me
/belong-belong/ or belong twice to the club.[fn:13] In the example
above, $1$ /belongs/ to $A$, so it doesn't need to belong again.

Splitting hairs? Yes, well, set theory is a very fundamental thing in
higher math, thus, very precisely defined based on axioms. For
example, set theory has the /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_extensionality][Axiom of Extensionality]]/ which states
@@html:<font color = "#0d3db3">@@ two sets are equal if they both have
the same members@@html:</font>@@. In our example $A$ and $B$ do indeed
have the same members, namely, $1$ and $2$ ---and it doesn't matter,
it doesn't count that $A$ repeats these members. Let's look at another
example

⌜\\
𝖟𝕭: Given the *set* $A = \{\text{good, so-so, bad}\}$ and a defined
(named) *list*

#+name: 7f8774e8-5919-413d-8134-dfd3652d7b39
#+begin_src scheme :eval never :exports code
(define week3 '(bad so-so so-so so-so good))
#+end_src
⌟\\

the set $A$ contains the three possible moods a person might be in;
while ~week3~ is the name we've told Scheme to call a list containing
our daily workweek moods.[fn:14] \\

The order of set $A$ doesn't matter (and we'd ignore, say, a second
$good$), but the order of the list defined as ~week3~ is important
because we don't want to mix up how we felt on which of the five work
days. Also, it makes perfect sense for a list to have "repeats" since
we're evaluating many days in succession, and each day can be one of
the three choices. But then notice one more thing about a set: When we
built the list ~week3~ we had to choose for each day ~good~ /or/ ~bad~
/or/ ~so-so~. Or did we? What would the list ~week3~ look like if we
could have more than just one mood during a day? How about

#+name: 5e0271e8-a0e4-430f-b594-f11e30c11403
#+begin_src scheme :eval never :exports code
(define week3 '(bad bad so-so (good so-so bad) (good so-so)))
#+end_src

Remember Venn diagrams? An /or/ situation can be shown with a **[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(set_theory)][union]]**
of circles.[fn:15] Let's make a formal definition of a union:[fn:16]

@@html:<font color = "#0d3db3">@@ The union of two sets $A$ and $B$
(denoted by $A \cup B$) is the set of elements which are in $A$, in $B$,
*or* in both $A$ and $B$.  @@html:</font>@@[fn:17]

Now, for our set $A = \{\text{good, so-so, bad}\}$, if we are using
each element just once per the day slot of ~week3~ we could imagine
$A$ as made up of the individual /singleton/ sets, i.e., sets having
just one element

\begin{align*}
A_G &= \{\text{good}\} \\
A_{S} &= \{\text{so-so}\} \\
A_B &= \{\text{bad}\}
\end{align*}

and so a union $\{A_G \cup A_{S} \cup A_B \}$ will get us back to our original
$A = \{\text{good, so-so, bad}\}$. $A_G$, $A_{S}$, and $A_B$ are
**[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_sets][disjoint sets]]** since they have no elements in common when we
union-ize them. And so if we made a Venn diagram, there would be no
overlap between any of them. Why are we couching our daily mood
choices in the language of set theory? Because we will eventually move
on to another language, namely, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell][Haskell]], where a certain class of data
types emulate just this sort of **[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction][logical or]]**, i.e., the **sum
type**. While Scheme is usually not directly explained in terms of
higher math, the Haskell family of languages (Haskell, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ML][Standard ML]],
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCaml][OCaml]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_Sharp_(programming_language)][F#]]) are. Again, lots more about data representations of
disjoint sets, logical conjunction and disjunction when we look into
Haskell in the future.

⌜\\
𝖟𝕭: Consider three common alphabets as sets---the Greek, Latin, and
Cyrillic alphabets

\begin{align*}
G &= \{Α, Β, Γ, Δ, Ε, Ζ, Η, Θ, Ι, Κ, Λ, Μ, Ν, Ξ, Ο, Π, Ρ, Σ, Τ, Υ, Φ, Χ, Ψ, Ω\} \\
L &= \{A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\} \\

&  Ы, Ь, Э, Ю, Я\}
\end{align*}

Now, let's make one big union-ed together set $A$ out of the
individual sets $G$, $L$, and $C$

\begin{align*}
A &= \{ Α, Β, Γ, Δ, Ε, Ζ, Η, Θ, Ι, Κ, Λ, Μ, Ν, Ξ, Ο, Π, Ρ, Σ, Τ, Υ, \\
& Φ, Χ, Ψ, Ω, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, \\

& О, П, Р, С, Т, У, Ф, Х, Ц, Ч, Ш, Ъ, Ы, Ь, Э, Ю, Я\}
\end{align*}

Below we see a Venn diagram for $A$, i.e., circles in which the
/three/ sets of alphabetic characters are contained. We can see how
the intersecting circumference lines also show the what /any two/
alphabets share, and then in the very center what they /all/ share

Of course for visual purposes not /all/ the letters could be crowded
into the diagram above, but we can see how the Venn diagram with its
overlapping circles trick is beating duplicates. Visually we can see
this happening, but is there a formal explanation? Short answer: yes.

Now let's look at a formal definition of union in so-called
**set-builder notation**[fn:18]

\begin{align}
A \cup B = \{x : x \in A \lor x \in B  \}
\end{align}

This expression says the **union** of $A$ and $B$ equals the set of
elements denoted by $x$ such that an $x$ can be an element from[fn:19]
$A$ *or* an element from $B$.[fn:20] But wait, *or* doesn't quite
sound right in English if we mean to union-ize two or more things,
does it?  To bring two or more sets together as one---their unique and
shared element alike---don't we mean to say, e.g., @@html:<font color

Now, look at that bulging middle triangle region of Figure 2
containing the letters all three alphabets have in common. This is the
**[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(set_theory)][intersection]]** of alphabet sets $G$, $L$, and $C$. In this case we

words, the letter has to belong to all three alphabets. This is more
precise, something upon which higher math always insists.

And with one final piece of the puzzle we can put to rest this whole
duplicates within sets issue. Let's explore another logic concept that
we actually encounter every day. In the modern world we're constantly
turning things on and off, e.g., a light switch with its on-off
toggle. But occasionally we see /two/ buttons---/one/ for on, /one/
for off. In the image to the right we have /two/ buttons doing on and
off instead of one. In such a case pushing the green /on/ button just
one initial time turns the device on /and any additional pushing is
disregarded/. This is the same for the red /off/ button. Push once for
off---and any further pushes mean nothing. Basically, "I heard you the
first time, you don't have to repeat yourself." This phenomenon has an
official name: **[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence][idempotence]]**, and it crops up in many real-life
places. For our set theory discussion imagine making a Venn diagram of
the union of sets $S_1 = \{5\}$ and $S_2 = \{5\}$, i.e., two different
sets containing the same single element. Wouldn't this union be just
one single circle containing the element $5$? Indeed it would. And if
we added another set $S_3 = \{5\}$ to the union, we would still have

\begin{align*}
S_1 \cup S_2 \cup S_3 = \{5\}
\end{align*}

i.e., just one circle representing $5$. In fact, we could union
together an infinite amount of **singleton**[fn:21] sets of the form
$S_n = \{5\}$ and they would produce the singleton set $\{5\}$. Now
for a bit of abstraction. Consider a **[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_operation][binary operator]]**, i.e., any
math that takes two objects and does an operation on them to produce
something new. For example, addition is a binary operation, $1 + 1$ is
$2$, as is multiplication, $3 \cdot 5$ is $15$. Let's then use the
abstract symbol $\oplus$ to indicate any sort of binary operator. Now we
can establish a formal definition of idempotence \\

@@html:<font color = "#0d3db3">@@
- A **binary operation** $\oplus$ is said to be **idempotent** on a set $S$ if

  binary operator $\oplus$ if $x \oplus x = x$
@@html:</font>@@

If multiplication is the binary operator on the set of all counting
numbers $\mathbb{N}$ then what numbers of $\mathbb{N}$[fn:22] can we
call idempotent according to the definition? Well, only $0$ and $1$
are idempotent:

\begin{align*}
0 \cdot 0 &= 0 \\
1 \cdot 1 &= 1
\end{align*}

All other numbers ($x \gt 1$) give increasingly larger squares of
themselves, hence, $0$ and $1$ are idempotent, but the binary
operation of multiplication is not.[fn:23]

Now, let's consider something that came up in a [[https://math.stackexchange.com/][StackExchange
Mathematics]] discussion [[https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/155475/1-1-1-origin-of-this-convention][here]], which is tackling our issue of duplicates

So by the /idempotency/ of $\lor$ we have (2) the same as $\{ x : x = 1
\}$, hence,
\begin{align*}
\{1,1\} = \{1\}
\end{align*}

Notice we are relying on the **logical-or** binary operator being
idempotent for all $x$ in the set. Generally, an **unordered n-tuple**
is a set of the form $\{a_1,a_2,\ldots, a_n\dots\}$, although a **tuple** is
usually meant to be **ordered**.[fn:24] Again, idempotency of two
identical sets is obvious when seen as Venn diagrams, but now we've
seen in exact language how they are idempotent.

By the way, **union** and **logical or** are complimentary ideas. Consider
this expression

\begin{align}
a \in X \cup Y \iff a \in X \lor a \in Y
\end{align}

What does that double-arrow in the middle mean? **if and only
if**. We'll go into $\iff$ in more exact detail later, but for now it
means @@html:<font color = "#0d3db3">@@the truth of one side of the
$\iff$ requires the other side to be true also.@@html:</font>@@ So if
$a$ is an element of the union of $X$ and $Y$ then $a$ must be an
element of $X$ /or/ it is an element of $Y$ /or/ it is an element of
/both/ $X$ and $Y$ ---and the other way around as well. Note: we avoid
writing $X \lor Y$ when considering just the sets without involving the
elements therein.

** Summing up; data and data structures

We didn't even get off the first page of TLS, but we have laid some of
the groundwork we'll need to proceed. And we can't emphasize this
enough: Computer science is a branch of applied mathematics, and we
need to get the math going alongside, parallel to the computer
stuff. So expect more new math. Yes, this sort of math takes
concentrated, deliberate thinking. We're becoming philosophers, i.e.,
we're going beyond "plug-and-chug" math.

Next, **lists**. While this lesson was an informal introduction to
lists, we'll learn more about how they are a very simple but important
data structure in computer **data management** ... but then we're
using the term data management differently then the greater lay world
does. So a quick word about the whole concept of **data** and **data structures** before we really dive in ahead. Today the term /data/ is
mainly understood to be gobs and gobs of stuff held in databases or
other storage schemes. That's not what we mean by data. For us /data/
can simply be a number returned from an algorithm. That is to say,
data is what the programming logic, the /code/ is taking in, working
on, then giving back to us. Yes, of course, this production of data
can pool and amass into great piles in vast electronic storage bins,
but, for instance, this is data

#+name: 6ce99fb1-93d3-4a72-9e01-5d9b96f3c682
#+begin_src scheme :eval never :exports code
'(bad bad so-so so-so good)
#+end_src

i.e., just a simple list surrounded in parentheses and prefaced at the
beginning by a quotation mark ("'") as is the custom in Scheme (and
Lisp). That quote at the opening parenthesis indicates this is not
code, rather, data. What we saw above

#+name: e4667fd4-1f04-4d95-ac36-ee0ee01b44ca
#+begin_src scheme :eval never :exports code
(define week3 '((bad bad so-so so-so good))
#+end_src

is therefore a mixture of both code and data---making it our first
Scheme program, even if it is just one line long! As we progress we'll
get into the weeds on just how this mixture of code and data can work
together.

* Footnotes

[fn:1] College mathematics curricula usually do not have a separate
course for just set theory, rather, higher math texts typically have
an introductory chapter or two on sets. Computer science curricula
typically introduce sets in their Discrete Math courses.
﻿

[fn:2] In reality it's slightly more complicated. You see, set theory
is technically a specific "first order language". Set theory is a
theory formulated as a first-order language. We'll explore this fact
as we progress. This means we use the rules and tools of first order
logic to notate and construct set theory.

[fn:3] We'll get to why he uses the term /comprehension/ after some
preliminaries. Hint: it's a very non-intuitive, theoretical
mathematical use of the word.
﻿

[fn:4] In Prolog a predicate is lower-case and a variable is upper-case.
﻿

[fn:5] Again, we're creating a tool bag of components with which to
systematically, /operationally/ construct sets. Notice the similarity
to language---as if we're describing the basic components of a
language. Hold that thought...
﻿

[fn:6] A /signature/ is basically the same as a first order /language/.

[fn:7] The following section comes from the very wonderful /[[https://slc.openlogicproject.org/slc-screen.pdf][Sets,
Logic, Computation An Open Introduction to Metalogic]]/ (SLC)) from the
amazing [[https://openlogicproject.org/][Open Logic Project]]. We'll add interesting anecdotes along the
way.
﻿

[fn:8] Recall, the math symbol $\in$ means /is in/ (membership) and $\notin$
means /is not in/.
﻿

[fn:9] With ~(1)~ we see the most basic mathematical notation for a
set, i.e., /all/ the sets' elements listed out in a row, separated by
commas, enclosed in a set of curly brackets.
﻿

[fn:10] Can we say this about words, e.g., are the words /hot/ and
/hoot/ the same? No. Words are not sets of letters, rather, /lists/ of
letters. More later.
﻿

[fn:11] Read as, /$x$ such that $x$ is a natural number $\mathbb{N}$ and
$x$ is less than $4$/. This is known as /set-builder/ notation.
﻿

[fn:12] No real "information" is contained in, say, listing milk
twice. Typically, no one would think "That means get /two/ milks."
﻿

[fn:13] ...paying double membership fees?
﻿

[fn:14]  Notice once again the nested parentheses. To be sure,
everything in Scheme is a list.

[fn:15] A Venn diagram of two sets /or/-ed, /union/-ed together. \\
[[file:images/VennUnion.png]] \\
The lens-shaped center area represents the "overlap," i.e., what the
two sets represented as circles have in common.

[fn:16] $\cup$ is the symbol for union.

[fn:17] Could we have said, ...in $A$ *and* in $B$ *and* in both $A$
and $B$? Better not. More on why later.

[fn:18] (1) can be expanded for the union of more sets than just
two, e.g., $A \cup B \cup C \cup \ldots$.

[fn:19] The symbol $\in$ means "in" or "member of."

[fn:20] $\lor$ is the symbol for **[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction][logical or]]**, aka **logical
disjunction**. Take a crack at the Wikipedia article.

[fn:21] As we saw above, a **singleton** (also known as a **unit set**
or **one-point set**) is a set with exactly one element.

[fn:22] $\mathbb{N}$ is the symbol for the /natural/ numbers, i.e., the
positive integers $1$, $2$, $3\ldots$ we use to count things.

[fn:23] In her 2023 layman's book /The Joy of Abstraction/
mathematician Eugenia Cheng notes how the operation of mixing paint
colors is basically idempotent. Why? If we add one paint to one other
paint we always get just one new paint color. That is, there is never
an additive or multiplicative increasing or intensifying, just a new
color. Now, how can we explain the green on-button above in terms of
set-theory idempotency?

[fn:24] ...such as, e.g., a pair of /Cartesian coordinates/ $(a,b)$
where $a$ is some real number on the /x-axis/ and $b$ is a real number
on the /y-axis/. Obviously, with a Cartesian coordinate system $(a,b)
\neq (b,a)$, since they'd be entirely different points on the plane. The
only exception would be if $a = b$.
