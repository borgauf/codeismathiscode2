** Mathematical logic

If someone completely ignorant of math asks "What is math?" we might
simply answer, "Math is the art of developing useful generalizations
about specific situations." If they then ask, "What do you mean by
generalizations?" we could say "Generalization is the /abstraction/ of
specific situations into what they all have in common, i.e., /general/
rules that apply to these many specific situations." In any case, the
whole philosophical "we observe and conclude" dynamic is what is
behind mathematics ... which makes math a form of philosophy. Chances
are, however, that you have never experienced math in a philosophical
way. Up until now it's always been about "problem solving." We mean to
go further than mere problem solving.

But why do we need to abstract and generalize? Yes, we might need
certain formul√¶ that let us get answers to, say, how much our mortgage
payments should be. But do we need to go so deep into abstractions and
generalization?

A story or two to that question. First Gottfried Leibnitz is
considered by many to be the father of modern mathematical logic. He
was the first to ask seriously if we could create a mathematically
manipulatable calculus for human thought. But he also attempted to
find a "real" definition of a straight line, saying the commonly
accepted definition, namely, the shortest distance between two points,
only described a property straight line. But by finding evermore
fundamental abstractions, math gains in power, depth, and breadth.

A curious example of getting deeper and broader would be Einstein's
/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity][General Theory of Relativity]]/, which took the abstraction of gravity
to previously unimaginable heights. Before Einstein, physics relied
on Issac Newton's all but complete computational model of gravity as a
real force ($F$)

\begin{align*}
F = G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}
\end{align*}

On the other hand, Einstein's General Relativity described gravity as
an "artifact of four-dimensional space-time geometry." Physicists
today are unanimous in considering Einstein's explanation of gravity
the superior, overarching, "meta" view, even if gravity has been
seemingly downgraded to an "artifact."

Now let's take one more look at axiomatizing and abstracting stuff. \\

** Axiomatic thinking redux

Let's take apart a simple arithmetic calculation from primary school

\begin{align*}
2 + 3 \cdot 7
\end{align*}

which we were taught (read conditioned) to reduce to $23$ without much
theoretic talk of what exactly we were doing or what it all really
meant. First we see [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number][numbers]], e.g., $2$, $3$, and $7$. These are
/symbols/ representing amounts or aggregates. Then we have operator
/symbols/, here, "$+$" and "$\cdot$". These operators /operate/ on the
number symbols following precedence rules. And so to get $23$ from
$2 + 3 \cdot 7$ we acknowledge that the multiplication is done before
addition. We then evaluate $3 \cdot 7$ to $21$, which we substitute in for
the expression $3 \cdot 7$. This process could be called "reducing to
simplest terms". It could also be called /rewriting/. This may seem
too simple to worry about, but higher math gets curious whenever a
bunch of symbols like this start interacting, moving around. This is
computing, and computer science wants to know exactly what's happening
in order to automate it.


** Peano axiomatizes mathematics

So-called higher math wants to ground math in logically unassailable,
fundamental, formalistic, foundational bedrock. This became a serious
pursuit of math starting in the late nineteenth century. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Peano][Giuseppe
Peano]] put forth his [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms][Peano Axioms]] in 1889, which became that bedrock
upn which all math could be built. 




** Propositional logic

@@html:<font color = "#0d3db3">@@ The term *[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_calculus][propositional logic]]* (PL)
contains the root *proposition*, which is a statement that can be
evaluated to be true or false, as well as how these statements may be
combined.  @@html:</font>@@

PL is the most basic form of logic, started mainly by the Greeks,
largely centered around Aristotle, literally to sort out
thinking. Fast forward to the nineteenth century when the English
mathematician [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole][George Boole]] in his books /The Mathematical Analysis of
Logic/ and /The Laws of Thought/ went about modernizing Aristotelian
logic. Boole's attempt to answer the existential question, Can we
formalize, mathematize human thought? resulted in *Boolean algebra*,
which, among other things, became the basis of digital computer
circuitry.




** Implication

We want to discuss the *if-then-else* sexp we saw before in more
depth. An /if statement/ is a programming application of the general
math concept of the *[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_conditional][implication]]*.

Consider the conditional statement /If it snows, the snowplows
will come out/. This is also contains, i.e., something is
being implied. The symbol used for implication is a right-pointing
arrow between the *antecedent* (or hypothesis) and the *consequent*
(or conclusion) like this

\begin{align*}
p \longrightarrow q
\end{align*}

and can be phrased in many different ways

- $p$ implies $q$
- if $p$ then $q$
- $p$ only if $q$
- $q$ if $p$
- all $p$ are $q$
- if $p$, $q$
- whenever $p$ is true, $q$ is true
- $q$ is true whenever $p$ is true
- $q$ is necessary for $p$ (or, if $p$ is true, then $q$ is necessarily
  true)
- $p$ is sufficient for $q$ (or, for $q$ to be true, it is sufficient
  to show $p$ is true)  

Let's use these in normal sentences

‚åú \\
ùñüùï≠: /If you live in Wichita, the you live in Kansas./

- You live in Kansas if you live in Wichita.
- To live in Wichita is to live in Kansas.
- You must live in Kansas to live in Wichita.
- To live in Wichita suffices to live in Kansas.
- Any resident of Wichita is a resident of Kansas.
- Being a resident of Wichita implies residency in Kansas.

...and many more twists of wording. \\

Proofs in mathematics are typically based around implications. Here is
an axiomatic truth about integers

@@html:<font color = "#0d3db3">@@ The integer $n$ is even if there
exists an integer $k$ such that $n = 2k$, and $n$ is odd if there
exists an integer $k$ such that $n = 2k + 1$. Note that every integer
is either even or odd, and no integer is both even and odd. Two
integers have the same parity when both are even or both are odd; they
have opposite parity when one is even and the other is odd.
@@html:</font>@@

Now, a /direct proof/ of any sort of conditional statement of the form
$p \longrightarrow q$ will rely on the truth of implication. A theorem
we need to prove as valid will typically start by assuming the $p$
part, the hypothesis, then use axioms, definitions, givens, as well as
previously proven theorems to prove the $q$ part must also be
true. Let's see an example

‚åú \\
ùñüùï≠: Prove that @@html:<font color = "#0d3db3">@@if $n$ is an odd
integer, then $n^2$ is odd@@html:</font>@@

We obviously see an implication in the wording. But first, let's
develop a more formal, higher math way of expressing

** Syllogisms

*[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogism][Syllogisms]]* are a typical starting point with logic. The classic
Aristotelian syllogism goes like this

- *Major premise*:  All humans are mortal.
- *Minor premise*:  All Greeks are humans.
- *Conclusion/Consequent*: All Greeks are mortal.

Why not abstract this?[fn:1]

\begin{align*}
&\text{All H are M}& \\
&\underline{\text{All G are H}}& \\
\therefore\: &\text{All G are M}&
\end{align*}

Again, we see symbols (letters) standing in for specific
things. But obviously we can't just stick anything in for the letter
symbols. False premises will only get us false conclusions.

\begin{align*}
&\text{All fish are towns.}& \\
&\underline{\text{All guppies are fish.}}& \\
\therefore\: &\text{All guppies are towns.}&
\end{align*}

This would only make sense if all fish are towns.

** Hypothetical syllogisms

As a part of the *[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothetical_syllogism][hypothetical syllogism]]*
is a variation of syllogisms where /conditional/ statements are
made. 





The pure hypothetical syllogism looks like this

\begin{align*}
&p \longrightarrow q& \\
&\underline{q \longrightarrow r}& \\
\therefore\: &p \longrightarrow r&
\end{align*}




As we discussed in the first section, higher math wants to be
/axiomatically/-based, i.e., we have basic /axioms/ and
we /deduce/ with valid rules of inference useful facts, these useful
generalization. And this process of deduction involves crafting
propositions, declarations that can be checked as we construct them as
/true/ or /false/.



In the previous section we touched lightly, briefly on recursion with
some examples, but as we saw, recursion relies on the ability to /test
the progress/ of the recursion, the iteration in order to know when to
invoke the base case and thereby end the iterating. One thing we see
with our first exposure to /if-then-else/ is how a computer language
can be very compact and terse. In Scheme we don't even mention the
/then-else/ part of the /if-then-else/ conditional. The whole
conditional sexp is just ~(if (> n 12) 1 0)~ where we see the strict
Scheme syntax of ~(operator operand1 operand2 ...)~, hence, we must
assume the /then/ and /else/, i.e., ~(if (> n 12) then 1 else 0)~.

Inference causal versus non-causal.
