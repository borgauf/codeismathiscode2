The 2016 Hollywood film <i><a href="https://youtu.be/v-pbGAts_Fg">Hidden Figures</a></i> is a story about the
early-1960s space race. In one scene we see NASA&rsquo;s scientific team of
mathematicians, physicists, and engineers trying to figure out how to
get a space capsule flying in orbit around the Earth back on the
ground. Ironically, they know how to get the capsule in orbit, <i>but
they don&rsquo;t know how to get it back down to the ground again</i>. And so
they need to come up with the math to transition the vehicle from an
<i>elliptical orbit</i> around planet Earth into a (half) parabolic-shaped
descent path<label id='fnr.1' for='fnr-in.1.572549' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.1.572549' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup>
Technically speaking, a spacecraft orbiting the Earth is in an
<i>elliptic</i>, not circular orbit. And the path back to Earth after
breaking this orbit will resemble half of a parabola turned on its
side, hence, the adjective parabolic.
</span> back down on the ground. This is a rare moment in a
popular Hollywood film where they actually get the science right. That
is to say, there is no magic, no special effects, no superheroes with
super-human powers, no brainiac grade-schooler who hacks Pentagon
computers in three seconds; instead, just a bunch of ordinary-looking
people from disparate backgrounds putting their heads together to
solve a critical problem.
</p>

<p>
Why is this so special?  Because during the process of finding the
answer we see the math coming out of books, out of heads, and being
put to work on a real-world, life-or-death problem. The icing on the
cake is how the film depicts the team getting the just-delivered IBM
mainframe computer (that initially no one knows how to run!) to help
them. Takeaway: In the world of STEM you&rsquo;re never far from the
front lines, the cutting edge, the &ldquo;no one has done this before.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Fast-forward to today where <i>tens of billions</i> of computing
devices&#x2014;nearly all much more powerful than that first NASA
computer&#x2014;are doing computations big and small in every corner of the
world. Of course most of these calculations are relatively simple, but
many are quite complex. This is the sort of math that, pre-Computer
Age, would have been found only in dense books and dry collections of
tables, on classroom and office blackboards, embodied in mechanical
contraptions or analog electrical circuits, and, most mysteriously, as
&ldquo;mental representations&rdquo; in the brains of that small cadre of people
called <i>mathematicians</i>, <i>physicists</i> and <i>engineers</i>. Now math is
happening on computers. And so today we should not underestimate the
significance, the breadth and scope, the sheer amazing-ness of this
transfer of math from paper, chalk, and thought into code running on
very fast machines in our modern world.
</p>

<p>
Learning the skills necessary to run math and science on computing
devices will only increase in importance as we advance into the
future. Our mission: see the math, <i>grok</i><label id='fnr.2' for='fnr-in.2.4993595' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.2.4993595' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup>
To <b><b>grok</b></b> something is to understand it at its deepest level,
to <i>get it</i> so thoroughly that you merge with it and it with you,
coined by the sci-fi writer Robert Heinlein in his classic novel
<i>Stranger in a Strange Land</i>.
</span> the math, then get the
math going on the computer.

<p>
Here we are well into the twenty-first century and the elephant in
the middle of the room is <b><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">artificial intelligence</a></b></b>, or, the quest
to teach computers to actually think, i.e., reason, plan,
problem-solve, perceive, create, learn&#x2014;and not just passively run
software. In the past, it was widely believed teaching a computer to
handle, manipulate, if not at some level <i>understand</i> human language
was an integral part of raising computers up to some form of
human-like sentience. But the difficulty of this task was hugely
underestimated. Why? Because human language is <i>fraught</i>. Some
examples
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t like you&#x2026;</li>
<li>They did not not go into the city.</li>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t go nowhere today.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These are three examples of the <i>double negative</i>, a notoriously gray
area of language.<label id='fnr.3' for='fnr-in.3.5738824' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.3.5738824' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup>
If we said \(a = a\) and \(\lnot\; a = \lnot\; a\;\) and \(\lnot\;a
\ne a\) and that \(\lnot\; \lnot\;a = a\;\) what can we infer the \(\lnot\)
symbol is doing? More later.
</span> When we say, e.g., <i>It&rsquo;s not that I didn&rsquo;t
want to come to your birthday party&#x2026;</i>, we&rsquo;re not saying outright <i>I
wanted to come to your birthday party</i>, are we? No, to be sure, we&rsquo;re
being &ldquo;nuanced&rdquo; about what we really wanted to do about the birthday
party. But then mathematics say, <i>A negative times a negative is a
positive</i> &#x2014; and that&rsquo;s clear, black-and-white. But this is not the
case with double negatives in daily language use. Indeed, we humans
have an intuitive feel for what these examples mean&#x2014;even when
improperly formulated like the double negative in the last example
which probably should have been <i>I didn&rsquo;t go anywhere today</i>. But then
the statement <i>Due to the wind the snow was not falling straight down</i>
could mean the snow was moving <i>horizontally</i> as well as being
whooshed back upwards. Here the opposite of down is not only up, but a
third possibility, sideways. But then how could we tell a computer
about all these details, some of them logical, so many very odd,
non-rational illogical and hopelessly nuanced? More quicksand would
be all the wordplay, all the double/hidden meaning/entendre we employ
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
&#x2026;is from Lewis Carroll&rsquo;s <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland">Alice in Wonderland</a></i> and rhyme-plays on
the proverb, <i>Take care of the pence and the pounds will take care of
themselves.</i> Which itself is a variation of <i>penny-wise, pound
foolish</i>. How is a computer to know all these twists and
turns&#x2014;unless we simply specifically tell it about each and every one
of these twists and turns?
</p>

<p>
In his book <i><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262534741/thinking-as-computation/">Thinking as Computation</a></i> Professor Hector Levesque of
University of Toronto talks about <b><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_consequence">logical entailment</a></b></b> (LE) or
logical consequence, which is indeed purely logic consequences-based,
where we do in fact tell the computer, through logic-based programming
techniques, exactly what means what. For example, Levesque feeds a
coded version of the following <i>conditional</i> statement into a running
Prolog session<label id='fnr.4' for='fnr-in.4.9481302' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>4</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.4.9481302' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>4</sup>
<b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog">Prolog</a></b> is a programming language in which rules, facts, and
relational <i>predicates</i> are given, then logic <i>deductions</i> can be
made. More about all this upcoming.
</span>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
If X is a child of Y then Y is a parent of X.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If we then tell Prolog the fact
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
John is a child of Sue.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Prolog can then take this fact, look at the conditional, and <i>deduce</i>
that Sue is a <i>parent</i> of John &#x2026; and for this one single moment the
computer is doing something we humans do. But can this logical
entailment trick scale? Can we create a Prolog <b><b>knowledge base</b></b>
containing all the little facts about the world? Hold that thought&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Here&rsquo;s a joke with LE consequences
</p>

<p>
<i>Two people are walking along the beach when one says, &ldquo;Look! A dead
seagull!&rdquo; The other looks up into the sky and says, &ldquo;Where? Where?&rdquo;</i>
</p>

<p>
This is humorous because we consider it daft for someone to think that
just because seagulls are birds spending most of their lives sailing
up in the air, that when one dies it would remain aloft. But a
computer scientist might not laugh. Why? Because in our joke, the
logic of a dead bird no longer being able to fly is simply taken for
granted. But again, must we tell a computer literally everything? Here
we are facing the question of what can be deduced, inferred.
</p>

<p>
Consider this sequence of objects: \(\{1,\; nickel,\; 10,\; quarter,
\;50, \;?\}\). What should the last element &ldquo;?&rdquo; be?  Having experience
with these sorts of aptitude test questions, most Americans would say
\(dollar\). But to know that \(dollar\) completes the sequence assumes
much LE. A whole lot of facts must be in place before we have the
necessary knowledge base to <i>deduce</i> dollar. The bottom line is, in
the computer world logical entailment is a great big thing.
</p>

<p>
For your <i>early</i> information (lots more about this to come), Prolog is
essentially a computerized form of <b><b>Predicate Logic</b></b> or
<b><b>First-order Logic</b></b>. The programming of logical consequences and
entailment follows from the mathematical logic world first established
in the golden age of mathematical logic starting in the 1800s with
mathematicians like Cantor, Frege, Peano, Dedekind, Whitehead and
Russell, and many others. For example in mathematician Tom Apostol&rsquo;s
book <i>Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</i> (1976) he discusses the
details and derivation of the <b><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor">greatest common divisor</a></b></b> of two or
more numbers. As an exercise he asks the reader to <i>prove</i><label id='fnr.5' for='fnr-in.5.2232248' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>5</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.5.2232248' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>5</sup>
&#x2026;below, the tuple form \((a,b)\) means <i>the greatest common
divisor of \(a\) and \(b\).</i>
</span>
</p>

<p>
<font color = "#0d3db3">
If \((a,b) = 1\), then \((a+b, a-b)\) is either \(1\) or \(2\).
</font>
</p>

<p>
If we started unpacking the above statement&#x2014;we&rsquo;d be deep in a
<b><b>Number Theory</b></b> lecture reaching back thousands of years to a Greek
named Euclid. And yet much of AI research has been devoted to getting
computers to take in, to <i>grok</i> math axioms and theorems<label id='fnr.6' for='fnr-in.6.8061131' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>6</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.6.8061131' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>6</sup>
We&rsquo;ll explore <b><b>axiomatic mathematics</b></b> in great detail as we
go. For now just understand that <b><b>axioms</b></b> are basic, given truths
and facts, and <b><b>theorems</b></b> are derived using the basic axioms to
explain and justify them.
</span> to the point
that they can solve and prove just such a problem. In general, it has
long been known <i>there is great correspondence between formal math and
computer algorithms</i>, which is why discrete math emphasizes formal,
axiomatic mathematics. Lots more on this truism to come.
</p>

<p>
Early AI was solely based on logic as mathematics sees it. But
recently another type of AI has roared to the front. Today we are in
the middle of what is called <b><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence">generative artificial intelligence</a></b></b>
based on <b><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model">large language modeling</a></b></b> (LLM). You&rsquo;ve no doubt heard of
<i>ChatGPT</i>, <i>Gemini</i>, and <i>Grok</i>, no?<label id='fnr.7' for='fnr-in.7.6442931' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>7</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.7.6442931' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>7</sup>
By the way, <a href="gcdproof1.html">here</a> is a math proof generated by Google&rsquo;s
Gemini. Ironically, we&rsquo;ve essentially asked something not
logically-based to do, simulate logic&#x2026;
</span> Here&rsquo;s a good quote from
computer consultant Eugene Asahara
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The notion of training an LLM model is similar to that of training a
new skill into your human brain. We have no direct control over the
synapse wiring in our brains as we are trained. We train our brain
indirectly mostly through cycles of repetitions of exercises and
observations and adjustment tweaks over a period of time&#x2014;like the
proverbial, Train ten thousand hours to perfect a skill.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In other words, this new AI isn&rsquo;t trying to construct logical
entailment links&#x2014;one for every possible phenomenon&#x2014;and then forge
deductive links together. Generative artificial intelligence arises
from <i>conditioning</i> a brain-like <b><b>neural network</b></b> inside a computer
to respond properly. And yes, we can describe a problem to an AI
bot&#x2014;and presto! it seemingly magically gives us a response. For
example, if we ask <a href="https://grok.com/">Grok</a>
</p>

<blockquote>

&#x2026;followed by a lengthy explanation of the code almost simple enough

See <a href="primesUpTo.html">primesUpTo</a>, the Grok answer converted into a plain org
file.
</span> Now, does this mean Grok was
taught all the logical entailment of programming Haskell? Does it mean
all Haskell computer programmers are out of a job? No and no. Somehow
Grok &ldquo;learned to code&rdquo; even though it didn&rsquo;t really&#x2014;at least in any
logically traceable progression. But again, are all programmers out of
a job? No. What this really means is <i>now more than ever we need to
have even greater math and computer science knowledge</i>. Why?  Because
when we interact with AI we need to
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>know what to ask</li>
<li>know how to ask it</li>
<li>understand AI&rsquo;s response</li>
<li>be able to apply the answer</li>
<li>take responsibility for the code as a quasi-manager would take
responsibility of an underling&rsquo;s work</li>
</ul>

<p>
As Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia said,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
AI will not replace all humans, just those humans who do not use AI.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For an analogy, pocket calculators, beginning in the 1960s were feared
because some believed school children&rsquo;s arithmetic skills would go
soft. However, most mathematicians welcomed calculators, arguing that
they only freed up kids from tedious calculations to learn more,
better, higher math. This is a version of the old argument that a
building&rsquo;s quality isn&rsquo;t negatively impacted because the brick masons
used a forklift to move pallets of bricks rather than hand-carry
them. All in all, that last point, i.e., taking responsibility for
what you&rsquo;ve &ldquo;sub-contracted&rdquo; out to AI, will require top computer
science knowledge more than ever. The pace will increase, and you, the

<i>Informatik</i> is the German term for <i>computer science</i>. Edsger
Dijkstra, the famous Dutch &ldquo;computer scientist&rdquo; said, &ldquo;Computer
science is no more about computers than astronomy is about
telescopes,&rdquo; emphasizing that computer science is about the underlying
principles and methods, not just the machines themselves. Dijkstra
considered himself an applied mathematician and hardly ever used an
actual computer.
</span> will have to keep up.
</p>

<p>
Finally, today&rsquo;s generative AI is <i>not</i> conscious as humans are
conscious and perceptive. The vast majority of experts in the computer
science field all agree that large language model generative AI is a
dead end in the pursuit of <b><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence">artificial general intelligence</a></b></b>, which
is supposedly AI with real sentient consciousness. Watch this space&#x2026;

programming<label id='fnr.10' for='fnr-in.10.2061938' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>10</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.10.2061938' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>10</sup>
There are two general categories of &ldquo;giving instructions&rdquo; to a
computer in the form of computer programming: <i>imperative</i> programming with
statements and <i>declarative</i> programming with expressions. Read on.
</span>. But still to this day we do not fully understand
how we humans convey knowledge, instructions to one another. We don&rsquo;t
really know how one human teaches math to another. No surprise, but
it&rsquo;s likewise not obvious how we should &ldquo;do math&rdquo; on a computer. Yes,
at some stage of one human teaching, sharing math with another human,
and the teacher and student eventually get on the same page. The
student catches on, &ldquo;syncs up&rdquo; their understanding with the teacher&rsquo;s,
and the knowledge is duly conveyed, mathematical abstraction
grokked. Still, if we don&rsquo;t really understand how math is mentally
represented in a human brain, nor how one mental representation gets
reconstructed in another&rsquo;s brain, then adding the digital computer
into this mix makes everything even more mysterious and intriguing. In
order to bring the computer into this process our mantra will be
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<font color = "#650d1c">Code is math is code</font>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
meaning the transfer, the syncing up of math must happen alongside
producing representative code, i.e., we&rsquo;ll combine learning math with
learning to <i>code</i> that math.
</p>

<p>
Contrary to what various &ldquo;learn to code&rdquo; promoters<label id='fnr.11' for='fnr-in.11.8196407' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>11</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.11.8196407' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>11</sup>
Most &ldquo;learn to code&rdquo; initiatives are rushed oversimplifications
primarily geared towards only a narrow part of the huge and diverse IT
world. User-interface (UI) coding is emphasized, while the other
branches, e.g., data management, systems programming, and especially
computational-numerical programming aren&rsquo;t covered or are given
short-shrift.
</span> might say,
the programming part of this puzzle cannot simply be a stand-alone
boot camp-style cram session. <i>Oh no,</i> you might say, <i>there&rsquo;s already
so much math to learn, and here&rsquo;s yet more to learn!</i> Yes and no. Yes,
it will be challenging, but we believe teaching math with code and the
code with math will make both realms come alive and be fun to
learn. We&rsquo;ve seen this pairing make beautiful music together, and we
want to build on this winning combination<label id='fnr.12' for='fnr-in.12.7200933' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>12</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.12.7200933' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>12</sup>
One huge inspiration for CIMIC is the book <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Classical_Mechanics">Structure and
Interpretation of Classical Mechanics</a></i> by Gerald Jay Sussman, Jack
Wisdom, and Meinhard E. Mayer. And this was based in part on Donald
Knuth&rsquo;s <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate programming</a></i> initiative, also championed by Timothy
Daly.
</span>.
</p>

<p>
So if computer programs are written in computer programming languages,
what language shall we write our code in? This may seem a
controversial choice to some, but we&rsquo;ll start out with Scheme (a Lisp
dialect), which is a functional language, then transition to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)">Haskell</a>,
a <i>typed, purely functional</i> <label id='fnr.13' for='fnr-in.13.711221' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>13</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.13.711221' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>13</sup>
We&rsquo;ll dive into what <i>typed</i> and <i>functional</i> languages are
later&#x2026;
</span> language. One big reason Haskell
is our choice is that it is, beyond any doubt, the most math-centric,
math-conscious language there is. Pick up Haskell and it <i>oozes</i>
mathematical elegance<label id='fnr.14' for='fnr-in.14.3252421' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>14</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.14.3252421' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>14</sup>
Often enough, you can open a higher-level math text, e.g.,
abstract algebra, pick a topic, then google Haskell and your obscure
abstract algebra topic and, chances are, somebody has explored a
code-is-math-is-code treatment of it, written libraries for it.
</span>. But why choose Haskell with its rather
steep learning curve? Why not learn, say, an easier &ldquo;blub&rdquo; language?
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)#Blub">Blub</a> languages have earned this not-so-flattering name by <i>not</i> being
<i>functional</i> languages. What does that mean? Let&rsquo;s begin to unpack
this now.
</p>

<p>
When you write code in non-functional Blub, you are basically telling,
controlling the computer &#x2014; sometimes literally line-by-line &#x2014; what
to do. <i>Literally</i> line-for-line programming would be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language">Assembly</a>
coding. But imperative languages such as C/C++ will have you
explicitly, manually managing your program&rsquo;s memory. That is to say,
<i>memory management</i> is done by the programmer and not automatically
handled behind the scenes as it now is in most modern languages. This
is a hold-over from the early days of the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture">von Neumann
machine</a>-based digital computers of the 1950s. <i>Imperative</i> programming
is where each line is a command, a statement, an imperative
instruction.
</p>

<p>
A functional language, on the other hand, is based primarily on the
mathematical concept of a <i>function</i>. Functional languages are
<i>declarative</i><label id='fnr.15' for='fnr-in.15.7408686' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>15</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.15.7408686' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>15</sup>
Maybe peruse <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming">this article</a> on declarative programming. Don&rsquo;t
worry, we&rsquo;ll cover all this in depth as we go.
</span> where <i>code can be considered mathematical
statements in the form of true mathematical functions</i>. One main
advantage of being declarative and function-based programming is that
our code will conform to math function behavior, that is, when we put
something into a function we get back exactly <i>one</i> answer&#x2014;and not
one answer now, then perhaps a different, unexpected answer the next
time because the <i>state</i>, the conditions of the program have changed.
</p>

<p>
When did you first hear about a true function having only one output?
You probably don&rsquo;t remember, but a hint would be, <i>A vertical line is
&ldquo;undefined.&rdquo;</i> In a future section we&rsquo;ll discuss middle-school math
notions of functions plotted on a Cartesian coordinate system versus
higher math&rsquo;s more thorough treatment. Below we see in the top graphic
a supposed function that maps one \(x\) coordinate to <i>three</i> \(y\)
coordinates. But this violates the one-output rule, therefore, this
line cannot be expressed as a traditional function. See the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_line_test">vertical
line test</a>.  <br>
<br>
<img src="images/Vertical_line_test.png" alt="Vertical_line_test.png"> <br>
</p>

<p>
This might seem too hair-splittingly abstract so early in our
discussion, but functional programming&rsquo;s only-one-output,
side-effects-free feature is an absolute necessity for computational
predictability.<label id='fnr.16' for='fnr-in.16.9115149' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>16</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.16.9115149' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>16</sup>
We&rsquo;ll discuss no side effects or <i>referential transparency</i>,
the technical term for this idea, later, but in the meantime you might
want to take a crack at the Wikipedia article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency">here</a>.
</span> Being able to know and trust your code helps
reduce bugs and errors that may crop up as rude surprises when your
program suddenly does something other than what you were expecting it
to do<label id='fnr.17' for='fnr-in.17.362816' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>17</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.17.362816' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>17</sup>
It might be hard to get all of what Charles Scalfani is saying
in his <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/functional-programming">IEEE Spectrum</a> article <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/functional-programming">Why Functional Programming Should Be the
Future of Software Development</a>, but one easy take-away is that
non-functional languages don&rsquo;t scale well due to lack of referential
transparency and too much state juggling. A typical Blub-written
project without referential transparency must rely in extensive
testing and debugging &#x2014; which can&rsquo;t always find all the worst-case
scenarios where an input produces the wrong output.
</span>. By the way, there&rsquo;s a very big push these days to make
code &ldquo;provable,&rdquo; i.e., guaranteed to do what it&rsquo;s supposed to and not
what it&rsquo;s not supposed to do. Typed functional languages like Haskell
are the base camp of this mountain.
</p>

<p>
Again, this only-one-answer predicability is built-in to math
functions &#x2014; right? Yes, of course it is! And why this is true
can be seen in how math defines functions. We&rsquo;ll soon take a
higher-math dive into exactly what a math function is and why it&rsquo;s so
important in functional programming.
</p>

<p>
So if not Blub, why not a CAS<label id='fnr.18' for='fnr-in.18.9956131' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>18</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.18.9956131' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>18</sup>
CAS is short for <i>computer algebra system</i>. Wikipedia has a good
article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra_system">here</a>.
</span>, i.e., a math software package
like <i>MatLab</i>, <i>Wolfram Mathematica</i>, or <i>Maxima</i>, or a numerical
package available with Python such as <i>SymPy</i>? The short answer is we
really should learn to do hands-on programming. Why? Because software
packages with ready-made plug-and-chug solutions won&rsquo;t help us learn
to negotiate the real computationally-based STEM world. <i>But I&rsquo;ve
heard Python is very popular for math stuff</i>, you might say. For an
analogy, doing math with Python is like eating soup with a butter
knife (C++ with a steak knife). Scheme and Haskell&#x2014;for many
reasons&#x2014;are like eating soup with a spoon. They&rsquo;re the best
utensils for what we&rsquo;re after here.
</p>

<p>
Learning Scheme and Haskell will fall into two categories:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>theory deep dives, and,</li>
<li>toolbox-building</li>
</ul>

<p>
A deep dive will take us on an exploration of just how and why Scheme
or Haskell is doing something the way they do, i.e., based on
math. Again, functional is math-friendly, especially
Haskell<label id='fnr.19' for='fnr-in.19.2535754' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>19</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.19.2535754' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>19</sup>
&#x2026;as well as its very worthy siblings in the typed functional
sphere: SML, Ocaml, Purescript, and F#.
</span>. Toolbox-building, on the other hand, will be more
&ldquo;learn to code,&rdquo; only with Scheme and Haskell, we&rsquo;re learning syntax,
semantics, <i>first principles</i> hands-on. So yes, with Scheme or Haskell
we may build our own calculator, our own CAS, but we&rsquo;ll go beyond
calculation into concepts.<label id='fnr.20' for='fnr-in.20.1650310' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>20</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.20.1650310' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>20</sup>

<p>
Since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Luria">Alexander Luria</a>&rsquo;s groundbreaking studies of the IQs of
pre-literate people in the Caucus Mountains, we&rsquo;ve gradually come to
see abstraction as a much more complicated beast than
before<label id='fnr.22' for='fnr-in.22.3344225' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>22</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.22.3344225' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>22</sup>
See <a href="https://youtu.be/9vpqilhW9uI">James Flynn</a>&rsquo;s TED talk, and read the first chapter of James
Gleick&rsquo;s <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Information:_A_History,_a_Theory,_a_Flood">The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood</a></i>.
</span>. Long story shortened, math can be a very imposing
vertical wall of abstraction. And, as Luria discovered, there may even
exist social and cultural barriers, actual social-psychological
resistance <i>against</i> abstraction and symbolism that our milieu has
imbued us with. We cannot simply assume that any and all abstraction
and symbolism can and will be instantly grokked by our math
audience<label id='fnr.23' for='fnr-in.23.5913226' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>23</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.23.5913226' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>23</sup>
The classic line, &ldquo;What is this for? Why are we doing this?&rdquo;
is the elephant in the middle of the math classroom.
</span>. But if we approach the abstraction curve with respect
for its difficulty and steepness <i>and</i> we don&rsquo;t resort to force or
hand-waving,<label id='fnr.24' for='fnr-in.24.8263294' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>24</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.24.8263294' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>24</sup>
To <i>hand-wave</i> in science is to dismiss or downplay
complexity, to skip over or sweep something difficult under the
rug. We will avoid hand-waving at all costs.
</span> we can master deeper symbolism and abstraction. We
must build up the abstraction receptor sites in our brains, so to
speak.
</p>

<p>
By the way, mathematics is just as much about words as it is about
numbers and formulae. Of course some math doesn&rsquo;t require any
words. There is the story of an American math professor who
&ldquo;translated&rdquo; Russian math books &#x2014; without understanding a word of
Russian. But that is very rare. A typical upper-level math text on,
e.g., abstract algebra or real analysis, will have the reader
weighing, pondering every word in every sentence, over and over. You
may spend a week trying to wrap your head around just one page of one
chapter. Hence, we need to develop a very sharp, precise and exacting
focus on what words really mean, what they really imply. <i>And</i> we need
to expand our math and computer science vocabulary. A doctor who had
just graduated from medical school once said his school had
emphasized, to what seemed an extreme degree, the knowing of
terminology, remembering sheer masses of words. This will be somewhat
similar. Because if we get the words and their precise meaning
down&#x2014;the learning will go much smoother. Otherwise, every sentence
risks becoming bogged down in ambiguity and confusion.

One big, <i>big</i> mistake in the teaching and learning of math,
especially in the public K-12 world, is <i>conditioning</i>. When circus
masters train (torture) their animals, they simply repeat routines
over and over (under duress) until the animal finally complies,
although with no real understanding of what&rsquo;s going on. Does the rat
being forced to negotiate a maze or the lion to jump through a burning
hoop know, understand what the idea, the concept, the purpose is?
No. They&rsquo;re simply in a stimulus-response <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism#21st-century_behaviorism_(behavior_analysis)">behaviorist</a> loop.<label id='fnr.25' for='fnr-in.25.4849930' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>25</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.25.4849930' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>25</sup>
Mathematician Eugenia Cheng talks about Kindergartners
learning the &ldquo;counting poem.&rdquo; Children are taught to count to ten on
their fingers, \(1,2,3,\ldots\). Now, are they really learning anything
of the mathematical symbolism of numbers&#x2014;or are they just imitating,
rote-learning a group activity?
</span>
</p>

<p>
This sort of behaviorist conditioning can be in the form of <i>rote</i>
learning &#x2014; which everyone agrees these days is not the best way. And
yet we hear math teachers saying over and over, in one form or
another, <font color = "#650d1c">When you see this, do
this.</font> Mathematician <a href="https://longformmath.com/">Jay Cummings</a> calls this <i>The
Way</i>. So in your math class you are shown <i>The Way</i> to solve
problems. You see The Way used in examples, then The Way is employed
to solve the exercises at the end of the chapter. And when you see
problems on a test, you respond by using The Way. But learning math by
simply piling up as many The Ways as possible rarely leads to any real
understanding of math, let alone its purpose, let alone its aesthetics
or beauty.
</p>

<p>
What&rsquo;s the alternative to rote, behaviorist conditioning, to The Way?
Better would be concept-based learning, getting above the details into
carefully constructed, carefully worded, carefully delineated
generalizations where similarities and patterns can be grouped and
mentally aggregated into a deeper understanding. Another technique is
to simply <i>triangulate</i>, i.e., hit the problem from different angles,
not be afraid to see off-beat examples. Yes, The Way is often
unavoidable, but with careful triangulation, deeper meaning can be
gleaned. More on all this learning psychology as we progress.
</p>

<p>
Another great technique is to start at some finished piece of math &#x2014;
and methodically unpack it, go down all the rabbit holes, take into
account the history, the people behind the supporting
ideas<label id='fnr.26' for='fnr-in.26.8791831' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>26</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.26.8791831' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>26</sup>

The American public K-12 math curriculum is designed to be a smooth,
gradual on-ramp for further mathematics, physics, and engineering
studies at the college level. This strategy started back in the Cold
War Era when we found ourselves behind the Russians as they were the
first to put a satellite in orbit in 1957. The so-called &ldquo;Sputnik
crisis&rdquo; resulted in a scramble to improve American math, science, and
engineering. Problematic is how today in the twenty-first century this
mid-twentieth-century curriculum does practically nothing to prepare
students for the ever-growing, evermore-important sector of
computational math and computer science. Today&rsquo;s incoming college
Freshmen choosing computer science are confronted with many strange
and alien concepts they&rsquo;ve never seen before, the main one being
<i>discrete</i> mathematics<label id='fnr.27' for='fnr-in.27.7675764' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>27</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.27.7675764' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>27</sup>
We&rsquo;ll learn plenty about discrete math as we go. But for a
quick introduction, consider a light switch that goes on or
off. That&rsquo;s two <i>discrete</i> states. The opposite of discrete would be
<i>continuous</i>. So think of a volume control knob on your radio,
<i>continuous</i> in that it <i>continually</i> changes, i.e., one <i>continuous</i>,
uninterrupted sweep from soft to loud.
</span>. Without any previous exposure to the
specialized math of computer science, the first two, three, four
semesters of a college comp-sci degree are typically a quick-time
march to catch up<label id='fnr.28' for='fnr-in.28.8811130' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>28</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.28.8811130' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>28</sup>
Imagine wanting to study math in college after having seen
absolutely <i>no</i> math K-12. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Core_State_Standards_Initiative">Common Core State Standards Initiative</a>
has taken steps to narrow this gap. Much of their math curriculum
attempts to expose kids to a discrete math, if not a computer
algorithm way of seeing math. But in our humble opinion it&rsquo;s far too
little.
</span>. The result is, nation-wide, high
drop-out/flunk-out rates in CS departments&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
&#x2026;but not necessarily at the elite universities with their
90th-percentile students. At the world-class STEM schools the pace is
fast and furious, but the majority survive. At the second-tier
schools, however, this sort of pace usually isn&rsquo;t maintained and
corners are cut. And so a two-tiered world has emerged, one group
getting a solid CS education, the other getting a watered down,
sometimes nothing but a vocational school version of CS. Here we will
attempt to build an on-ramp to computer-centric math alongside,
complimented by coding that is, in turn, grounded back into solid math
and computer science. To accomplish this we&rsquo;ll explore the world of
discrete math, algorithms,<label id='fnr.29' for='fnr-in.29.3919073' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>29</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.29.3919073' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>29</sup>
You&rsquo;ve no doubt heard of <i>algorithms</i>. Very simply put, an
algorithm is a set of instructions, imagine perhaps a baking recipe,
that produces a mathematical cake. In computational math, we&rsquo;re
basically redoing, reimagining math formulae as algorithms which then
can run on computers. Lots and lots more about algorithms as we move
along.

people. Those who self-motivate, self-educate, and are able to create
their own future; and those who wait around for events, circumstances,
more powerful people to tell, force them what to do.

Where are we going? What do we expect to achieve? The Computer Age has
forced a split between what is now called <i>continuous</i> math, i.e., the
math of physics and engineering; and <i>discrete</i> math, the math brought
to the fore by the theoretical implications and requirements of
computers. We know what continuous math is &#x2014; as we&rsquo;ve mentioned, the
K-12 math curriculum concentrates on it. And we can readily see what
it does, i.e., the modern technology all around us. But where is the
computer-led side of science and technology going? Many today might
say it has gathered around AI. But teaching a computer to really
think, not just imitate it, has proven to be an elusive goal. To keep
pace in the Computer Age we must have a good understanding of its
mathematical and theoretical foundation. Let&rsquo;s start now.
