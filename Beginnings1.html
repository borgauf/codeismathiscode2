<p>
Objects by themselves or objects together. No doubt many life forms
have an instinctual, intuitive, working grasp of these two basic
contrasting situations. We humans have language, and this brings logic
and symbolism to intuition. Consider the statement
</p>

<p>
<font color = "#0d3db3">
together \(\implies\) not alone, not separate
</font>
</p>

<p>
The \(\implies\) arrow is from mathematical logic and means <i>implies</i>,
or, roughly, &ldquo;<i>if</i> you say this, <i>then</i> you are also saying this.&rdquo;
Reading the statement backwards
</p>

<p>
<font color = "#0d3db3">
not alone, not separate \(\implies\) together
</font>
</p>

<p>
we notice a simple &ldquo;if <i>not</i> this then that&rdquo; situation. In both
statements we can decide whether they are true or not. In math logic
this is called a <i>proposition</i>.
</p>

<p>
<font color = "#0d3db3">
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>I like you.</li>
<li>Hand me that bottle.</li>
<li>Did you just get here?</li>
</ol>
<p>
</font>
</p>

<p>
Out of these three sentences only #1 is a true proposition, or, a real
statement that can be resolved to <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>. #2 is a
command, and #3 is a question. Of course #2 and #3 can be answered
with yes or no, but not true or false.<label id='fnr.1' for='fnr-in.1.8101394' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.1.8101394' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup>
There is a story of the famous physicist Paul Dirac who,
finishing a lecture, asked the students if there were any questions. A
student said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand how you got&#x2026;&rdquo; But Dirac seemingly
ignored the student. A professor then asked Dirac if he would answer
the question. Dirac replied, Was there a question? I only heard a
statement.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Above, <font color = "#0d3db3">together \(\implies\) not alone,
not separate</font> is a statement that is either true or
false. We might simply believe it to be true, but it may not
be. Lurking somewhere might be a situation where together does not
really imply or mean not alone and not separate. One case may be
riding on a city bus. Yes, you can technically be together with all
the other passengers, but still quite alone and separate from all the
people you do not know.
</p>

<p>
<i>Aristotelian logic</i> as put forth by Plato&rsquo;s student Aristotle in the
third century BC begins with three rules
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Identity: A thing is itself, or, \(A \text{is} A\)</li>
<li>Excluded middle: A proposition is either true or false, or, \(A \or
   \not A\)</li>
<li>Contradiction:</li>
</ol>




<p>
, i.e.,
<i>negation</i>, i.e., <i>not</i> alone, as well as <i>not</i> separate would be
together. A negation of yes is no and a negation of positive is
negative.<label id='fnr.2' for='fnr-in.2.2061938' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.2.2061938' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup>
You have no doubt heard of <i>double negatives</i> where &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not
that I don&rsquo;t like you&rdquo; (I do like you) or &ldquo;There is no way you are not going to clean
your room&rdquo; (you <i>are</i> going to clean your room).
</span>
</p>

<p>
Math logic has a toolkit of exacting methods and a whole zoo of
symbols to establish truth. Consider this
</p>

\begin{align*}

\end{align*}



<p>
<i>Logical entailment</i> or <i>logical consequence</i> is the notion that one
statement can follow from another. A formal definition of entailment
would be
</p>

\begin{align*}
\alpha \vDash \beta \iff M(\alpha) \subseteq M(\beta)
\end{align*}

</div>





<div id="outline-container-org0b22235" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org0b22235">If together, how many?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0b22235">
<p>
Abstraction and symbolism have taken humanity into a modern science
and technology landscape that, as far as we know, is unique in the
known universe.
</p>


<p>
things that were <i>together</i>, not just
singular by themselves? We would see more than one thing&#x2014;perhaps
similar, perhaps close to one another&#x2014;and the notion of relatedness,
togetherness, <i>clumpiness</i> would come to us. Human language Some vague idea,
if not language, dealing with <i>amount</i> rose from <i>how big</i> the clump
of things we mentally clumped together seemed.
</p>

<p>
The general phenomenon of singular and plural, one or more, seemed to
beg the question <i>if more, then how many more?</i> And so the <i>size</i> or
<i>degree</i> of a clump of things means something and should be
considered.
</p>

<p>
Along with clumpiness, groupings, stuff together, we probably also
were aware of the passing, the demarcation of
time, such as the seasons cycling. And <i>shapes</i> could be categorized
as well.<label id='fnr.3' for='fnr-in.3.7200933' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.3.7200933' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup>
Geometry.
</span> But let&rsquo;s stick with clumpiness for a while.
</p>

<p>
Communication, semantics of these clump details evolved. A couple, a
pair, a herd, a school, a few, many, lots, lots and lots, lots and
lots and lots. And today terms like <i>cardinality</i> or <i>degrees of
multiplicity</i> offer a high level of <i>abstraction</i> of one or many.
</p>

<p>
All of this points to a very unique thing about humans, namely, our
high levels of cognizance, awareness, our ability to note our
intuitive awareness and build on it. Of course other critters are able
to distinguish between one and many. But do they put these notions,
these impulses into words&#x2014;and then build these ideas into higher and
more exacting and more abstract ideas? Of course humans experience
life at an intuitive level, but unlike animals, we take the intuitive
and give it logical structure, we codify these notions, ideas,
intuitive hunches. We, far more than any other species take basic
phenomena and create abstract representative mental structures.
