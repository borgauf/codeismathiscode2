The perception of objects: separate or together, one or many, close or
far away. Higher life on this planet would seem to have an innate,
<i>intuitive</i> grasp of such contrasting conditions. We humans have
language, and this brings logic and symbolism to formalize
intuition. Consider the <i>statement</i> 
</p>

<p>
<label for='mn-auto.9790334' class='margin-toggle'>&#8853;</label><input type='checkbox' id='mn-auto.9790334' class='margin-toggle'><span class='marginnote'> The ⟹ arrow is the mathematical logic symbol for <i>implies</i>, as when one thing <i>implies</i> another thing. Or, roughly, &ldquo;<i>if</i> you say this, <i>then</i> you are also saying this.&rdquo; We&rsquo;ll describe all the math logic symbols as we go. </span>
</p>

<p>
⇲ <font color = "#0d3db3">&nbsp;&nbsp;
together \(\implies\) not alone, not separate
</font>
</p>

<p>
A statement is also called a <i>proposition</i>. The first thing to know
about propositions is they are either <i>true</i> or <i>false</i>. As in, We
<i>propose</i> this to be true, but it might be false. Reading the statement
backwards 
</p>

<p>
⇲ <font color = "#0d3db3">&nbsp;&nbsp;
not alone, not separate \(\implies\) together,
</font>
</p>

<p>
we see a simple &ldquo;if <i>not</i> this, then that&rdquo; situation. Both version are
statements, or propositions we can decide to be true or not. But not
every utterance is a statement. For example
</p>

<p>
<font color = "#0d3db3">
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>I like you.</li>
<li>Hand me that bottle.</li>
<li>How has your day been?</li>
</ol>
<p>
</font>
</p>

<p>
Out of these three sentences only #1 is a proposition, a statement
that can be resolved to true or false. #2 is a command, and #3 is a
question. Of course #2 and #3 can be answered with yes or no, or good
or bad, but not with true or false.<label id='fnr.1' for='fnr-in.1.8061131' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.1.8061131' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup>
There is a story of the famous physicist Paul Dirac who,
finishing a guest lecture, asked the student audience if there were
any questions. A student said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand how you got&#x2026;&rdquo; But
Dirac seemingly ignored him. A professor then asked Dirac if he would
answer the question. Dirac replied, Was there a question? I only heard
a statement.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Our <font color = "#0d3db3">together \(\implies\) not alone,
not separate</font> makes sense, seems true. But could there
be lurking somewhere a situation where <i>together</i> does not really
imply or mean <i>not alone</i> and <i>not separate</i>. What about riding on a
city transit bus? Yes, you can technically be together with all the
other passengers, but still be quite alone and separate from all the
people you do not know. The takeaway is we have a two-part process:
First, the statement, then whether it is true or false.

<h3 id="org79c4fb7">Law of thought</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org79c4fb7">
<p>
Aristotle, who lived in third century BC and was Plato&rsquo;s best-known
student, based his logic on three rules
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><i>Identity</i>: A thing is itself, or, \(A \; \text{is} \; A\)</li>
<li><i>Excluded middle</i>: A proposition is either true or false, or, \(A \lor
  \neg \,A\)</li>
<li><i>Contradiction</i>: A proposition cannot be both true <i>and</i> false at
the same time.</li>
</ol>

<p>
These seem rather&#x2014;obvious, to the point of being silly. However,
logicians and mathematicians must be formal and thorough about
it. Let&rsquo;s analyze each in turn.
</p>

<p>
➝ \(A \; \text{is} \; A\) <br>
is probably the most pedantic and even tedious seeming. But in the
quest to force nebulous intuitive phenomena to conform to logical
thought and speech, we must at least use symbols consistently. Again,
it seems obvious that a dog is a dog, but we cannot have dogs randomly
be cats. If Shakespeare&rsquo;s Juliet declares
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
What&rsquo;s in a name? That which we call a rose, by any other word would smell as sweet.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
we still need whatever the rose is now called to stay that name and
not have different names coming in and out of usage at random. This
speaks to a need for consistency.
</p>

<p>
Aristotle said
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
If &#x2026; one were to say that [a] word has an infinite number of
meanings, obviously reasoning would be impossible; for not to have one
meaning is to have no meaning, and if words have no meaning our
reasoning with one another, and indeed with ourselves, has been
annihilated; for it is impossible to think of anything if we do not
think of one thing&#x2026;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Again, language is forcing us to exactness. Aristotle also employs
symbols such as <i>X</i> and <i>A</i> to generalize his argument
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
if &ldquo;man&rdquo; means X, then if A is a man X will be what &ldquo;being a man&rdquo; means.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
Again we see implication<label id='fnr.2' for='fnr-in.2.8101394' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.2.8101394' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup>
&#x2026;and more generally, an implication consists of a pair of
sentences separated by the \(\implies\) operator. Symbolically, \(p\)
implies \(q\) or \((p \implies q)\). The sentence to the left of the
\(\implies\) operator is called the <i>antecedent</i>, and the sentence to
the right is called the <i>consequent</i>.
</span> where if we have a meaning X given for
what a man is, then if an individual A is considered as man, then we
must stay with the meaning X of what a man is. Man means X. A is a
man. Hence, A means X.
</p>

<p>
The British mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole">George Boole</a> emphasized the fact that with
language we use words, names, symbols, and these are in truth made-up,
markings on paper or blackboards, sounds, pronunciations, <i>but</i> they
must have set shapes, sounds, and meanings agreed upon by all users.
</p>

<p>
[What does Boole mean with Nothing &ldquo;0&rdquo; and Universe &ldquo;1&rdquo;: He observes
that the only two numbers that satisfy xx = x are 0 and 1. He then
observes that 0 represents &ldquo;Nothing&rdquo; while &ldquo;1&rdquo; represents the
&ldquo;Universe&rdquo; (of discourse). Is this some forcing logic? After all neg
times neg is forced by (50 - 2)(50 - 2) = 48 x 48, i.e., we follow one
trail taught in grade school to &ldquo;figure out&rdquo; 48 x 48, but is (50 -
2)(50 - 2) a forcing logic?]
</p>


<p>
➝ \(A \lor \neg\, A\) (A <i>or</i> not A)<br>
is quite prevalent in everyday life, even if we don&rsquo;t realize
it. Whenever we hear a statement such as <font color =
"#4715b3">If you don&rsquo;t clean your room, you&rsquo;ll be grounded for the
rest of the week!</font> Here the parent has created an excluded
middle: Clean your room, <i>or</i> be grounded&#x2014;excluding any other
possibilities. Harsh, but common in everyday life. Of course the usual
rebuttal is neither-nor or&#x2014;both. We see both when someone is offered
two appealing choices&#x2014;and doesn&rsquo;t want to be restricted to one or
the other, no both, please.
</p>

<p>
There cannot be a world where we

<div id="outline-container-org8a1512e" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org8a1512e">Negation</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org8a1512e">
<p>
Negative would be the opposite of positive. 
</p>

<p>
, i.e.,
<i>negation</i>, i.e., <i>not</i> alone, as well as <i>not</i> separate would be
together. A negation of yes is no and a negation of positive is
negative.<label id='fnr.3' for='fnr-in.3.7200933' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.3.7200933' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup>
You have no doubt heard of <i>double negatives</i> where &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not
that I don&rsquo;t like you&rdquo; (I do like you) or &ldquo;There is no way you are not going to clean
your room&rdquo; (you <i>are</i> going to clean your room).
</span>
</p>

<p>
Math logic has a toolkit of exacting methods and a whole zoo of
symbols to establish truth. Consider this
</p>

\begin{align*}

\end{align*}



<p>
<i>Logical entailment</i> or <i>logical consequence</i> is the notion that one
statement can follow from another. A formal definition of entailment
would be
</p>

\begin{align*}
\alpha \vDash \beta \iff M(\alpha) \subseteq M(\beta)
\end{align*}

<p>
[Humans enter a great palace when they attempt to move from intuition
to logic.]
</p>

<p>
[Algebra really started with A&rsquo;s syllogisms turning words to letters.]
</p>

<p>
[Boole: We can say anything. But we have to agree on ground rules of
what the symbols mean.]

<div id="outline-container-org72a3840" class="outline-3">

Abstraction and symbolism have taken humanity into a modern science
and technology landscape that, as far as we know, is unique in the
known universe.

<p>
things that were <i>together</i>, not just
singular by themselves? We would see more than one thing&#x2014;perhaps
similar, perhaps close to one another&#x2014;and the notion of relatedness,
togetherness, <i>clumpiness</i> would come to us. Human language Some vague idea,
if not language, dealing with <i>amount</i> rose from <i>how big</i> the clump
of things we mentally clumped together seemed.
</p>

<p>
The general phenomenon of singular and plural, one or more, seemed to
beg the question <i>if more, then how many more?</i> And so the <i>size</i> or
<i>degree</i> of a clump of things means something and should be
considered.
</p>

<p>
Along with clumpiness, groupings, stuff together, we probably also
were aware of the passing, the demarcation of
time, such as the seasons cycling. And <i>shapes</i> could be categorized
as well.<label id='fnr.4' for='fnr-in.4.9115149' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>4</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.4.9115149' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>4</sup>
Geometry.
</span> But let&rsquo;s stick with clumpiness for a while.
</p>

<p>
Communication, semantics of these clump details evolved. A couple, a
pair, a herd, a school, a few, many, lots, lots and lots, lots and
lots and lots. And today terms like <i>cardinality</i> or <i>degrees of
multiplicity</i> offer a high level of <i>abstraction</i> of one or many.
</p>

<p>
All of this points to a very unique thing about humans, namely, our
high levels of cognizance, awareness, our ability to note our
intuitive awareness and build on it. Of course other critters are able
to distinguish between one and many. But do they put these notions,
these impulses into words&#x2014;and then build these ideas into higher and
more exacting and more abstract ideas? Of course humans experience
life at an intuitive level, but unlike animals, we take the intuitive
and give it logical structure, we codify these notions, ideas,
intuitive hunches. We, far more than any other species take basic
phenomena and create abstract representative mental structures.
