Recently, someone asked me if I believed in astrology. He seemed
somewhat puzzled when I explained that the reason I don't is because
I'm a Gemini. \\

Up front and brutal: @@html:<font color = "#4715b3">@@ Computer
science is a branch of applied math.@@html:</font>@@ The main problem
with this simple fact is, from comp-sci department to comp-sci
department, to what degree, to what depth the math is taken can differ
wildly. That is to say, at each place different aspects, corners of
the applicable mathematics surrounding computer science will be
different from the next in how they approach, delineate, present this
"computer science" math. But one thing is certain, the standard
introductory courses in

Most computer scientists we the beginning of modern computer science
goes back to the mathematics of Alan Turing, Alonzo Church (a
professor of Turing's), Kurt GÃ¶del, and another student of Church's,
Stephen Kleene. Ironically Turing and Church were exploring the
mathematical logic of computation back in the 1930s, long before any
such device as a computer had been developed.[fn:1] They were
formalizing the general lore around David Hilbert's
/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entscheidungsproblem][Entscheidungsproblem]]/ (decision problem). Basically, it asks the very
fundamental question, Can we figure stuff out? but of course in a very
mathematically formal way using just logic.

#+begin_quote
The /Entscheidungsproblem/ asks for an /algorithm/ that considers an
inputted statement and answers "yes" or "no" according to whether it
is universally valid, i.e., valid in every [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_(mathematical_logic)][structure]].
#+end_quote

But then what in this high-flying mathematical sense is an algorithm
and what is a structure? We will pick these apart as we go.

Gottfried Leibniz is credited with getting this idea of translating
all questions to math and then cranking some mathematical device to
get an automated answer. Back in the 1600s he wondered whether a
mechanical computing device (or equivalent mathematics) could ever
boil all human thought down into math symbols and "process" them
objectively

#+begin_quote
Leibniz's idea of reasoning through a universal language of symbols
and calculations remarkably foreshadows great 20th-century
developments in formal systems, such as Turing completeness, where
computation was used to define equivalent universal languages.
#+end_quote

An example might be the infamous [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture][Collatz conjecture]], which asks if any
positive integer can be subjected to this (piecewise) function

\begin{align*}
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
n/2,  & \text{if $n$ is even} \\
3n+1, & \text{if $n$ is odd}
\end{cases}
\end{align*}

+ If the number $x$ is odd then perform $[3x + 1]$ successively until it
  is even (i.e., $x \; mod \; 2 = 0$)
+ If the number $x$ is even then perform $\frac{x}{2}$
  successively until it is odd

does the function eventually take the number down to $1$? For example,
consider $8$. Since $8$ is even, we divide by $2$ to get $4$, which is
even, so divide again by $2$ to get %2%. Then even $2$ is again
divided by $2$ to get %1%. Since $1$ is odd we multiply by $3$ and add
$1$ --- which is $4$... And so we are in an infinite loop. But as the
test asks, does $8$ arrive after a certain number of applications to
$1$? The answer is yes. @@html:<font color = "#4715b3">@@And yet
mathematicians have yet to prove if /all/ numbers can, after a finite
number of iterations, ever reach $1$.@@html:</font>@@


Not long ago a simple raise-to-the-power-of question like, e.g.,
$53^{1000}$, could put a computer into an infinite loop or make a hand
calculator simply reply ~gone fishin'~. But with the modern
programming language Racket we can do very large numbers indeed [fn:2]
